The Alzheimer's Association and Early Stage Advisory Group have urged the FDA to recommend traditional approval of Leqembi for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Leqembi was granted accelerated approval in January 2023 and Phase 3 data showed it met primary and key secondary endpoints with highly statistically significant results. The FDA will complete its review for traditional approval by July 6, 2023.
