Persistent loss of smell due to COVID-19 may be a better predictor of long-term cognitive and functional decline than the initial severity of the disease, according to new research presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. Hospitalization in an intensive care unit was found to be associated with double the risk of dementia in older adults. Women, unemployment, and lower socioeconomic status were associated with more cognitive symptoms during the pandemic in a study of nine Latin American countries. However, experiencing a positive life change during the pandemic reduced the negative impact of the pandemic on memory and thinking skills.
