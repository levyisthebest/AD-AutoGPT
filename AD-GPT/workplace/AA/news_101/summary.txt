Studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference suggest that persistent loss of smell due to COVID-19 may be a better predictor of long-term cognitive and functional impairment than the severity of the initial disease. ICU hospitalization was found to be associated with double the risk of dementia in older adults. Women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and those not working were found to have more cognitive symptoms during the pandemic. Positive life changes during the pandemic may reduce the negative impact on memory and thinking skills.
