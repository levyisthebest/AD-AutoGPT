A global workgroup convened by the Alzheimer's Association has released recommendations on the use of Alzheimer's "blood tests". While blood biomarkers show promise for improving the diagnostic work-up for Alzheimer's, they are not yet ready for widespread use in primary care settings. However, they are important and valuable for current research trials and cautious initial use in specialized memory clinics. The recommendations include short- and long-term research priorities and consensus appropriate use recommendations for blood biomarkers in the clinic and in research trials. The use of blood-based biomarkers could improve diagnostic accuracy and enable earlier referral to specialists and participation in clinical trials.
