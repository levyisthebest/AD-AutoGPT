Scientists have discovered 42 new genes linked to Alzheimer's disease, bringing the total to 75. Women are two-thirds more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's than men, and a gene called MGMT may explain this gender difference. Continued research into the genetic underpinnings of the disease is crucial. Federal funding for Alzheimer's research has increased sevenfold since 2011 to more than $3.4 billion annually. Early detection and intervention are crucial to ending Alzheimer's, and current treatments should focus on stopping neuroinflammation and the killing of neurons. The controversial amyloid-removing drug aducanumab has limited coverage under Medicare.
