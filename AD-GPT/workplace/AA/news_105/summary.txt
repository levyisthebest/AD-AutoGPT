New preliminary findings suggest that loss of smell due to COVID-19 may be linked to cognitive decline, particularly in adults over 60 years of age. A study tracked 766 adults for a year after their infection, with two-thirds experiencing some type of cognitive impairment at the end of that year. While more research is needed to confirm the link, studies have shown that loss of smell is a precursor to cognitive decline and COVID-19 can cause lasting loss of smell. Understanding the connection could help physicians intervene early and prevent cognitive issues in high-risk individuals.
