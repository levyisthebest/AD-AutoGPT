Research suggests that household chores, socializing, and exercise can lower the risk of developing dementia. A study in China found that frequent exercise reduced the risk by 35%, while household chores and social visits reduced the risk by 21% and 15% respectively. Another study in the UK found that higher levels of physical activity were associated with a lower risk of dementia. Researchers globally are investigating lifestyle practices to prevent dementia.
