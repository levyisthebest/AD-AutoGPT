CHICAGO, April 18, 2023 — The Alzheimer’s Association announced a commitment of €10 million ($10.85 million) to EQT Life Sciences’ LSP Dementia Fund, an international venture capital fund that invests in companies developing promising, high-impact treatments for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.
With more than 55 million people worldwide living with Alzheimer’s and other dementia, there is a significant need to propel the most promising investigational treatments into the next stages of trials.
“With this commitment, the Alzheimer’s Association is expanding our funding in varied and broader areas of dementia drug development to advance and diversify the pipeline and, eventually, the treatments available to people living with Alzheimer’s disease and all other dementia,” said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer. “This is just one example of how the Alzheimer’s Association is accelerating innovation in Alzheimer’s and dementia research.”
EQT Life Sciences is among Europe’s largest health care investment firms and has helped develop new diagnostic tools, treatments and devices for conditions including diabetes, heart failure and asthma. The LSP Dementia Fund, started in 2021, is managed by renowned neurologist Philip Scheltens, M.D., Ph.D., an international leader and former chair of the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference® (AAIC®) Scientific Program Committee. The Dementia Fund recently reached its hard cap of €260 million, which is above its original target fund size of €100 million.
“The LSP Dementia Fund is especially honored and thrilled to have the Alzheimer’s Association among its investors,” said Scheltens. “We thank the Alzheimer’s Association for their commitment and feel empowered to find new treatments for Alzheimer's and other dementias together with them.”
This new investment adds to the Association’s robust research funding portfolio that spans discovery science, early-detection development and early-stage clinical trials on a global scale. In addition to advancing late-stage clinical trials through the Dementia Fund, the Alzheimer's Association fuels early-stage clinical trials of promising therapies through its Part the Cloud initiative, which has invested more than $67 million in 65 clinical trials targeting a variety of known and potential new aspects of Alzheimer’s. Part the Cloud-funded projects have gone on to receive more than $1.2 billion in additional funding from the government and other sources.
