People with certain heart conditions are three times more likely to develop dementia than those with a high genetic risk, according to a study. The study found that those diagnosed with certain cardiovascular conditions, such as heart attack, diabetes, stroke, and heart failure, experienced a spike in their dementia risk. Managing diabetes and making healthy lifestyle changes can protect both heart and brain health. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider about heart health management.
