Caregivers are now tasked with combating loneliness and isolation in older adults, as social connections can improve quality of life and reduce agitation. Papa is a service that connects older adults with caregivers who provide socialization and assistance with daily tasks. The service partners with Medicare Advantage health plans and recognizes the value of nontraditional approaches to improve outcomes. Clinical psychologist Monica Vermani believes that social connections reduce the risk of dementia. A personal story is shared about two women who formed a friendship through a senior day facility, leading to one of them becoming a caregiver for the other who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
