A study by Tufts University has found a correlation between gum disease caused by the bacteria F. nucleatum and Alzheimer's disease in a mouse study. The bacteria can generate inflammation and migrate to the brain, exacerbating symptoms of Alzheimer's. The findings suggest that treating periodontal disease may decrease or delay the onset of Alzheimer's in humans. However, more research is needed to establish causation in humans.
