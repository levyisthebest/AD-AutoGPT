A new study warns that a deficiency in vitamin D can increase the risk of dementia. Low vitamin D levels were associated with lower brain volumes and a higher risk of dementia and stroke. Ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D through spending time outdoors, eating foods that contain vitamin D, and taking a vitamin D supplement can help reduce the risk of cognitive decline. More research is needed to determine if a lack of vitamin D is a risk factor for cognitive decline.
