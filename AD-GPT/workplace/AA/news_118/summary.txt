Regularly consuming ultra-processed foods can accelerate cognitive decline, according to two studies. One study found that those who consumed at least 20% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods had a 25% faster decline in executive functions and a 28% faster rate of overall cognitive impairment. Another study found that consuming ultra-processed foods is associated with worse cognitive performance in older people who do not have pre-existing diseases. Decreasing ultra-processed foods may be a way to improve impaired cognition among older adults.
