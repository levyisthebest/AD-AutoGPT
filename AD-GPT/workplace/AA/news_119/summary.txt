The CDC has identified five warning signs of Alzheimer's disease, including memory loss, confusion, personality changes, poor judgment, and problems with speaking or writing. Language functioning may be relatively spared in the early stages, but it is likely to decline substantially in the mid to late stages. Alzheimer's affects millions of Americans and speech comprehension may be significantly impaired during the end-stage of the disease. Individuals should consult with their doctor if they or a loved one are experiencing symptoms.
