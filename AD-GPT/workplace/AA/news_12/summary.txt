The Ad Council, Alzheimer's Association, and NASCAR have launched a PSA campaign featuring NASCAR driver Ryan Blaney sharing his family's experience with Alzheimer's disease. The campaign encourages families to have conversations with loved ones about changes in cognition or behavior and stresses the benefits of early detection, including access to treatment options and more time to plan for the future. The PSA will run on various media platforms, including donated support from NASCAR.
