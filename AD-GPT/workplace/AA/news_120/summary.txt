The Alzheimer's Association is advocating for greater diversity in clinical trial participation to ensure treatments are safe and effective for all ethnic and racial backgrounds. They are working on initiatives to address obstacles and reach underserved communities, including launching TrialMatch, a free service that matches patients to over 700 clinical trials. The Association is leading two major clinical trials with a focus on diverse participation and conducting community-based outreach. They are also partnering with organizations to disseminate information and hosting an International Conference with a focus on health disparities and equity. The goal is to increase intentional inclusion in Alzheimer's and dementia research.
