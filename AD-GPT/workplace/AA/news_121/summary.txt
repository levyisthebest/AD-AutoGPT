A study on mice found that long-term high fat diets worsened depression-like behavior and cognitive decline in mice with Alzheimer's disease, as well as exacerbating brain pathology associated with the disease. The study highlights the need for further research on the effects of high fat diets in humans with Alzheimer's, and suggests a connection between Alzheimer's disease and obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, it is important to note that the study was performed exclusively in mice, and human data is still needed.
