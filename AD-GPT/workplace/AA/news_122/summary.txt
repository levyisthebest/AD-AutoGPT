A study has found that getting vaccinated against the flu may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by 40% in a four-year period following the shot. Other vaccines have also been associated with a lower risk of dementia, but more research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms behind these results. Health authorities encourage flu vaccinations for their known safety profile.
