Plus, Part the Cloud awards $4.75 million to six new, innovative clinical trials
CHICAGO, JULY 12, 2022 — In a new milestone, projects funded by the Alzheimer’s Association’s Part the Cloud global research grant program have gone on to receive a total of $1 billion in follow-on funding from government entities, venture capital, industry and other funding sources. This follow-on funding has enabled studies to expand into clinical trials across the U.S., allow data sharing on a global scale and move potential treatments through clinical trials faster.
"The $1 billion in follow-on funding is a testament to Part the Cloud’s relentless mission to support promising new ideas and move them into clinical trials," said Michaela "Mikey" Hoag, founder and chairwoman of Part the Cloud. "I am continually amazed by this program’s impact on the growing Alzheimer’s and dementia therapeutic pipeline."
Continuing the momentum, six clinical trials investigating six promising therapies for Alzheimer’s and other dementias are being propelled forward thanks to $4.75 million in new grant funding from Part the Cloud. With this funding, research teams from around the world will explore high risk, high reward treatment strategies for Alzheimer’s and other dementias that focus on stimulating brain cells, reducing neuroinflammation, improving the brain’s metabolic function and more. The funding brings Part the Cloud’s total investment to $65 million in 65 research projects.
"This is an incredibly exciting time in Alzheimer’s and dementia research," said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer's Association chief science officer. "Through initiatives like Part the Cloud, the Alzheimer’s Association is leaving no stone unturned as we canvass every corner of the globe to find better ways to treat and ultimately end Alzheimer’s disease and all other dementia.”
The recent Part the Cloud grant awardees include:
Ross Paterson, Ph.D., University College London, United Kingdom: Capturing tau kinetics in a clinical trial of ASO NI0752 in Alzheimer's Institute of Neurology.
Jan Johansson, M.D., Ph.D., Artery Therapeutics, Inc., San Ramon, CA, U.S.A.: Human proof of concept of ABCA1 agonist CS6253 treatment.
Hung-Kai Kevin Chen, M.D., Ph.D., Elixiron Immunotherapeutics, Taipei, Taiwan: Modulate neuroinflammation by targeting microglia with the CSF-1R inhibitor EI-1071.
Suzanne Craft, Ph.D.,Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC, U.S.A.: A Phase IIA Trial of Empagliflozin and Intranasal Insulin for MCI/AD.
Michal Schnaider Beeri, Ph.D., Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel: Combination of intranasal insulin and dulaglutide to improve cognition in older adults with metabolic syndrome and high dementia risk
Amala Soumyanath, Ph.D., and Joseph Quinn, M.D., Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, Oregon, U.S.A.: Safety and Target Engagement of Centella asiatica in Cognitive Impairment.
Started by philanthropist Michaela Hoag in 2012, Part the Cloud is specifically designed to accelerate translation of findings from the laboratory, through trials, into possible therapies — filling the gap in Alzheimer's drug development by providing essential support for early-phase clinical studies. This research program actively brings together government, academia, companies and philanthropists to support the efforts of researchers and accelerate science to achieve effective treatments.
With dementia affecting 50 million people worldwide, and more than 6 million in the U.S. alone, there is an urgent need to identify therapies capable of preventing or reversing brain cell damage inflicted by Alzheimer’s and other causes of dementia.
