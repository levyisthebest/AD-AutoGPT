New studies suggest that getting a flu shot and getting enough sleep may help prevent Alzheimer's disease. People who received the flu vaccine were found to have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's, and those who slept less than six hours per night had higher levels of beta-amyloid in their brains, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.
