Seniors who are more likely to give money to anonymous individuals may be at a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease, according to a study by Bar-Ilan University. However, the study did not assess seniors who donate to recognized charitable causes. The findings could help physicians and caregivers better screen for the behavior that indicates both a developing health issue and an increased vulnerability to financial scams and exploitation. The Alzheimer's Association advises older individuals to be informed, vigilant, and aware to avoid financial harm.
