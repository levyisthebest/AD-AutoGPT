Alzheimer's Association advocates flooded two Senate budget hearings to push for FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments to be covered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Multiple senators recognized the advocates and questioned Secretary Becerra on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services decision to block access to these treatments. The Alzheimer's Association is urging CMS to reverse its decision and provide access to treatments.
