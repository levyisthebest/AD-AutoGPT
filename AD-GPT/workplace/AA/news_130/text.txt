CHICAGO, June 21, 2022 — In an important effort to help state and local health departments address brain health across the life course, the Healthy Brain Initiative’s (HBI) Leadership Committee, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Alzheimer’s Association, gathered on June 7-8, 2022 to kick off the development of a new HBI Road Map. The meeting began with excitement around the national uptake of the current HBI Road Map, which led to all states and many local health departments taking actions to improve brain health in their community. This new HBI Road Map will continue to provide public health officials with a set of strategies to realize a better future for all communities affected by Alzheimer’s and all other dementia. The Alzheimer’s Association is proud to lead this committee, which includes senior leaders in public health, subject matter experts across the care continuum, researchers and physicians from 20 different organizations.
"I'm proud to work with such a broad spectrum of organizations and experts to develop our next HBI Road Map, which will help achieve better outcomes for communities impacted by Alzheimer’s and other dementias,” said Kristen Clifford, chief program officer, Alzheimer’s Association and co-chair of the Leadership Committee. “Risk reduction, early detection and diagnosis, and management of dementia and Alzheimer's affect so many aspects of public health. Thank you to the leaders participating for your commitment to addressing this devastating disease."
At this meeting, the Leadership Committee began the year-long process to develop the next HBI Road Map, which will take input from over 100 experts in the field to compile a national perspective on the intersection of public health and brain health, dementia and caregiving. The Leadership Committee determined that risk reduction of cognitive decline, early detection and diagnosis of cognitive impairment, and dementia caregiving are essential public health areas that must be addressed in the next HBI Road Map. Further, the committee decided that the next HBI Road Map needed stronger emphasis and integration of health equity and utilization of a cross-sector systems approach. Expert workgroups on these topics will convene this summer to develop recommendations and guidance for the Leadership Committee to review later this year. There will also be an open feedback period for state and local public health and the public at large to provide comments on elements of the HBI Road Map.
For over 15 years, the CDC has guided and co-sponsored the evolving Healthy Brain Initiative Road Map Series. The CDC has taken the lead on Road Map implementation by supporting public health programs through BOLD Program awards. Currently, there are 23 BOLD Program awardees in state, local, county and tribal public health departments. Lisa McGuire, Ph.D. is the Lead of the Alzheimer’s Disease Program at the CDC and serves as the co-chair of the Leadership Committee.
“The guidance and resources provided in this work have proven invaluable to state and local health officials, and we are confident the next edition will only further advance the field and help address the growing Alzheimer’s and dementia public health crisis,” said Clifford.
The Leadership Committee is working to make the next edition of the HBI Road Map more action driven to help drive impact across the brain health continuum. The most recent HBI Road Map — Healthy Brain Initiative State and Local Public Health Partnerships to Address Dementia: The 2018-2023 Road Map — elevated public health awareness on dementia, cognitive health and caregiving. It continues to shape the national agenda around brain health.
The Alzheimer’s disease continuum spans decades, providing opportunities for public health to change outcomes in communities across the nation. Just as with other chronic and degenerative conditions, public health efforts can reduce risk, expand early detection and diagnosis, improve safety and quality of care for people living with cognitive impairment, and attend to caregivers’ health and well-being.
