The article discusses the relationship between sleep and dementia, highlighting the impact of sleep disturbances on cognitive function and the potential for sleep interventions to improve outcomes for those with dementia. Inadequate sleep duration may increase the risk of dementia, while sleeping for more than 9 hours a night may also increase the risk and lead to lower brain volumes. Quality sleep is important for brain function and can help clear the brain of Alzheimer's-related toxins. Sleep apnea is also linked to an increased risk of dementia, but effective treatments are available.
