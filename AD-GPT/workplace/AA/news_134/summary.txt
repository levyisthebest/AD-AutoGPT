A new study has found that the risk factors for Alzheimer's or another form of dementia depend on a person's sex, race, and ethnicity. The study identified eight modifiable risk factors, including midlife obesity, low educational attainment, and lack of exercise, that were most associated with developing future Alzheimer's. The findings suggest that people can take steps to reduce their risk of cognitive decline as they age by engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors such as maintaining a healthy weight or regularly exercising.
