Alzheimer's, dementias, and other cognitive impairments are a public health priority affecting over 55 million people worldwide, with a growing number experiencing Young-Onset Alzheimer's between the ages of 30 and 60. African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately affected. Early detection through cognitive assessments is crucial for implementing safety nets and compensatory strategies to maintain independence for as long as possible. However, just over 50% of primary care physicians do not feel comfortable diagnosing mild cognitive impairment. Maintaining connections with family and friends is crucial, and the Alzheimer's Association is a great source of support. Regular employment has ended for many living with Young-Onset dementia, and "work" looks different than a typical job.
