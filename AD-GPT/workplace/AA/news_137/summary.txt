People with early-onset dementia are sharing their experiences during Alzheimer's & Brain Awareness Month to raise awareness. They want to be addressed directly and not defined by their diagnosis.

Jobe, who has been in the industry for over 30 years, struggled to understand certain concepts and found it difficult to explain them to clients.
