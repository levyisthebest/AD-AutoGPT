Two studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2022 suggest that racism and discrimination may contribute to cognitive decline and memory problems. The studies found that exposure to racism leads to stress that affects the body and likely contributes to cognitive decline. The Alzheimer's Association is working to increase health equity through targeted outreach to underserved populations, education and information that reflect a community's chosen language, and relationships that are built on trust and respect.
