Animal therapy, including living and robotic animals, has been proven to benefit people with dementia by improving mood, facilitating social interaction, calming effects, and increasing physical activity. ProMedica's Arden Courts memory care communities use animal therapy for residents. Connected Horse is a therapeutic program that offers equine-guided workshops for people with dementia and their caregivers to communicate without words and practice mindfulness techniques.
