A study presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that a diet high in ultraprocessed foods can lead to a 28% faster decline in cognitive scores, including memory and verbal fluency, compared to those with a lower consumption of such foods. Ultraprocessed foods are those that are heavily processed and contain additives like fats, sugars, and artificial flavors.
