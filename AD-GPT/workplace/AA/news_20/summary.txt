Senators Susan Collins and Amy Klobuchar have been named the 2023 AIM Humanitarians of the Year by the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's Impact Movement for their policy contributions to the fight against Alzheimer's disease. They have championed legislation to address the needs of the more than 6 million Americans currently living with Alzheimer's, including expanding access to FDA-approved treatments and increasing research funding. The direct costs of caring for those with Alzheimer's are projected to cost an estimated $345 billion, including $222 billion in Medicare and Medicaid payments.
