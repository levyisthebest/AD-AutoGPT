The Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer's Act has been reintroduced in the House of Representatives, with the aim of improving care for those with Alzheimer's disease. The legislation proposes a new payment structure for dementia care management, which would make it easier for patients and caregivers to access care and support. The bill has bipartisan support and could save the federal government $21 billion over 10 years.
