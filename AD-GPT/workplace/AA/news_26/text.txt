Washington, D.C., March 3, 2023 — The Alzheimer’s Association and the Alzheimer’s Impact Movement (AIM) are proud to support the bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer's Act. This legislation would ask the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) to test a different payment structure for dementia care management. This model is an important tool that would improve the quality of care, ease the challenges of Alzheimer’s caregiving and reduce costs.
“The bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer’s Act seeks to streamline today’s complicated health care maze for people living with dementia and their caregivers,” said Robert Egge, Alzheimer’s Association chief public policy officer and AIM executive director. “We thank the bipartisan champions for reintroducing this innovative legislation and supporting those impacted by Alzheimer’s and dementia in communities throughout the nation.”
Providing care for an individual living with dementia involves many unique and often challenging elements. Individuals and caregivers have to navigate health needs ranging from working with primary care doctors and specialists to medication management. In addition to having complex medical needs — the management of which is complicated by cognitive impairment — these individuals have non-medical needs, ranging from support with daily personal care to handling finances.
Dementia care management is a model of care that enables individuals living with Alzheimer's and their caregivers to more seamlessly navigate the health care and social support systems and obtain more timely access to care. This model would provide person-centered services such as the development of a dementia care plan, care coordination and navigation, and caregiver education and support. In addition, the model would ensure patients have access to an interdisciplinary team of providers with expertise in dementia care management and reimburse providers through an incentive payment based on performance.
First introduced in the 117th Congress, the bipartisan Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer's Act was reintroduced by Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W. Va.) in the Senate. Thanks to the dedication of these leaders and AIM advocates, bipartisan support for this critical legislation reached 39 in the Senate last Congress. The Alzheimer’s Association looks forward to working with these congressional champions to continue growing bipartisan support for this important legislation.
