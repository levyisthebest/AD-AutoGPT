Chicago, February 21, 2023 — The Alzheimer’s Association and the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation are pleased to announce the establishment of the Fred A. Erb Clinical Research Science Fellowships. Each Fred A. Erb fellow will receive a $300,000 grant to advance cutting-edge research in Alzheimer’s and other dementias.
From a pool of approximately 40 highly competitive annual applications, the prestigious Fred A. Erb Clinical Research Science Fellowship will be awarded annually for the next five years to the two top-ranked proposals as determined by an international panel of experts.
Approximately 6.5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s, a number that is projected to rise to nearly 13 million by 2050. This devastating disease takes its toll not only on individuals and their families, but is estimated to cost the U.S. economy more than $300 billion a year, in addition to an estimated $271 billion in unpaid caregiving.
“The Alzheimer’s Association greatly appreciates the generosity of the Erb Family Foundation and its ongoing commitment to advance Alzheimer’s and dementia research,” said Maria C. Carrillo, Ph.D., Alzheimer’s Association chief science officer. “These fellowships will support career advancement for ten outstanding clinician scientists over the next five years to help expand and strengthen the field and move us closer to a shared goal of effectively treating and preventing Alzheimer’s and all other dementia."
“The work of the Fred A. Erb Clinical Research Fellows will help accelerate research globally to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s disease.” said Dr. Neil Hawkins, president of the Fred A. and Barbara M. Erb Family Foundation. “We believe that the professional development of early-career scientists is essential to growing a workforce that is ready to meet the challenges presented by Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.”
Funding for the fellowship comes from a $3.275 million grant from the Erb Family Foundation to the Alzheimer’s Association.
Since 2009, Alzheimer’s Association and the Erb Family Foundation have worked in partnership on a variety of research opportunities, including the Zenith Fellows Award Program, New Investigator Research Grant Program, International Research Grant Program, Ante-Amyloid Prevention Study, and U.S. POINTER.
