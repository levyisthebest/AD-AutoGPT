The Alzheimer's Association and Part the Cloud Honored for Best Health Fundraising Event in the 2nd Annual Anthem Awards
CHICAGO — February 15, 2023 – Part the Cloud, in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association, was announced today as Best Health Fundraising Event in the 2nd Annual Anthem Awards in recognition of the organization’s efforts to fund Alzheimer's research with the highest probability of slowing, stopping or ultimately curing Alzheimer's disease.
Part the Cloud provides crucial funding for early-phase clinical trials, serving as a catalyst for researchers to receive additional funding. Last year, Part the Cloud hit a milestone, with 65 funded projects going on to receive more than $1.2 billion in follow-on funding from government entities, venture capital, industry and other funding sources. In 10 years, Part the Cloud has raised over $65 million and evolved into a global movement to transform progress in Alzheimer's research and treatment, capturing the attention of philanthropist Bill Gates, who partnered with the organization to help spur a matching gift challenge that led to the funding of 19 additional trials.
“With Part the Cloud we have created a movement unlike any other in the Alzheimer’s and dementia space, inspiring funders and the scientific community to join us in helping move new and novel ideas into clinical trials,” said Mikey Hoag, Part the Cloud founder. “Together with the Alzheimer’s Association, we will leave no stone unturned as we work with the brightest minds from around the globe to find better ways to treat and ultimately end Alzheimer’s disease and all other dementia.”
The Anthem Awards was launched in response to the prevalence that social good has taken within the national conversation and cultural zeitgeist in recent years. By amplifying the voices that spark global change, the Anthem Awards are defining a new benchmark for impactful work that inspires others to take action in their communities. The 2nd Annual competition received nearly 2,000 entries from 43 countries worldwide.
“Since launching this platform in June 2021, we have seen that social change has emerged as a dominant force in mainstream culture,” said Anthem Awards Managing Director Jessica Lauretti. “The sheer number, breadth and overall quality of the entries shared with us in the 2nd Annual Awards is a testament to the strength of this growing movement and demonstrates an enduring commitment to the work that is both humbling and inspiring to see. From the war in Ukraine to protests in Iran and the ongoing battle for equality here at home in the States, the call for change not only perseveres but is a growing global chorus.”
Alzheimer’s disease has a far-reaching impact. According to the Alzheimer’s Association’s Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures, more than 6 million Americans over age 65 are living with Alzheimer's dementia and more than 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for people living with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. In 2022, it was estimated that Alzheimer's and other dementias cost the nation $321 billion and by 2050, these costs could reach nearly $1 trillion.
Anthem Winners are selected by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. Members include Nicholas Thompson, CEO, The Atlantic; Christina Swarns, executive director, Innocence Project; Zarna Surti, global creative director, Nike Purpose; Maurice Mitchell, national director, Working Families Party; Lindsay Stein, chief purpose officer, Tombras; Jennifer Lotito, president and chief operating officer, (RED); Lisa Sherman, president and CEO, The Ad Council; Emily Barfoot, global brand director, Dove, Unilever; Trovon Williams, senior vice president of marketing and communications, NAACP; Roma McCaig, senior VP of impact, Clif Bar; Michelle Egan, chief strategy officer, NRDC; Dinah-Kareen Jean, senior manager, social innovation, Etsy; Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO, GLAAD; Jad Finck, vice president of innovation and sustainability, Allbirds; Christopher Miller, head of global activism strategy, Ben & Jerry’s; Shayla Tait, director of philanthropy, The Oprah Winfrey Charitable Foundation.
