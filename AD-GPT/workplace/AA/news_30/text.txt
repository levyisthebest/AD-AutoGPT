Digital health company with innovative cognitive assessment and cognitive health program receives funds to advance solution.
CHICAGO, February 8, 2023 — The Alzheimer’s Association, the world’s leading voluntary health organization in Alzheimer’s care, support and research, and MATTER, the premier healthcare incubator and innovation hub, today announced the winner of the Alzheimer’s Association Pitch Competition, aimed at identifying innovations to increase cognitive assessment and early detection and diagnosis of dementia within primary care settings.
Capturing the $15,000 top prize in this year’s competition is Neurotrack, for its clinically validated digital cognitive tests that measure and monitor the state of one’s cognition paired with its cognitive health program, enabling individuals to make lifestyle changes to strengthen their cognitive health as they age. In addition to its monetary award, Neurotrack receives a six-month MATTER membership to access exclusive resources to further advance its business.
“Thank you to MATTER and the Alzheimer’s Association for encouraging the development of cognitive health technology. It’s rare that the topic of a pitch competition aligns almost 100% with your latest product effort, but this time it did,” said Jordan Glenn, Ph.D., chief scientific officer of Neurotrack. “Winning this competition validates the strength of our technology and the future impact it will have on the health care industry and the countless lives it will touch.”
“It’s our mission to make cognitive screening at scale a reality — and making it happen at the primary care level is key to that initiative,” Jordan continued. “Our new three-minute digital cognitive screening integrates within providers’ workflows and provides patients with objective results instantly during their annual wellness exam. It’s the perfect first-line tool to detect cognitive impairment, unlocking the door to early intervention and better outcomes.”
ALZpath was named runner-up in the competition, receiving a $5,000 award, for its solution that integrates blood-based biomarkers, cognitive assessment tools, and virtual care solutions and provides enhanced lifestyle coaching and support tools, improved access to clinical trials, and accurate diagnoses.
AROMA Sensory & Diagnostics received the Audience Choice Award, taking home $5,000 in recognition of its data-driven and scientifically validated solution that combines objective olfactory testing with machine learning algorithms to accurately diagnose cognitive decline. Other finalists in this year’s competition included Accexible and WellSaid.ai.
“Enhancing cognitive testing tools to help clinicians easily assess their patients who have concerns about memory and thinking is an important priority for the Alzheimer’s Association,” said Kristen Clifford, chief program officer of the Alzheimer’s Association. “The innovations shared during the finalists’ presentations offer great promise for facilitating cognitive assessments in physicians’ offices to help speed diagnosis, management and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia.”
Winners were announced on Feb. 2 during the Alzheimer’s Association Innovation Roundtable in Houston. Judges for the competition included Dr. Donald Aga, chief medical officer of Kelsey-Seybold Clinic; Dr. Joseph Gathe, a physician and medical leader committed to addressing the health and well-being of diverse communities; Katie Evans, chief mission engagement officer of the Alzheimer’s Association; and Kristen Clifford, chief program officer of the Alzheimer’s Association. Dr. Jennifer Arnouville, associate regional institutional medical director at WellMed Medical, provided the afternoon’s keynote address.
“Through this competition, we identified and engaged with more than one hundred innovators, physicians and educators interested in improving early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and other dementias,” said Steven Collens, CEO of MATTER. “We look forward to collaborating with Neurotrack over the next six months to continue to drive their innovation forward.”
The 2022 Alzheimer’s Association Pitch Competition generated nearly 50 submissions from 13 countries.
