The Alzheimer's Association provides resources and support for individuals with Alzheimer's and their caregivers, including information on diagnosis, treatments, legal and financial planning, caregiving, safety, and research. They also offer educational programs, virtual events, and an online community for support, promote brain health, and provide funding opportunities for international dementia research. The organization partners with various corporations and sponsors to support their mission. Experts are redefining the concept of "clinical meaningfulness" in Alzheimer's disease to better understand the impact of treatments on patients' daily lives.
