CHICAGO, January 30, 2023 — Lisa Barnes, Ph.D., is the new deputy editor of Alzheimer’s & Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association. This newly-created role is designed to reflect and adjust to the rapidly changing field of Alzheimer’s and dementia research by expanding the topics covered in the journal.
Alzheimer’s and Dementia: Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association emphasizes interdisciplinary investigations related to causes of the disease, risk factors, early detection, treatment interventions, prevention of dementia and the application of new technologies in health services.
“We will strive to improve diversity and end bias in research, while maintaining the high levels of rigor and quality that Alzheimer’s & Dementia is known for,” said Barnes, a cognitive neuropsychologist and Alla V. and Solomon Jesmer professor of Gerontology and Geriatric Medicine at the RUSH Alzheimer’s Disease Center at RUSH University Medical Center in Chicago. She is associate director of the RUSH Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.
“We plan to build an outstanding group of advisors who will ensure that Alzheimer’s & Dementia remains at the forefront of scientific integrity and groundbreaking Alzheimer’s research,” Barnes added.
The new deputy editor will provide editorial support, guidance and counsel to the editor-in-chief and the editorial board. She will also work with the editor-in-chief to enhance and guide the editorial staff.
“The Alzheimer’s and dementia field is evolving, and the changes to the journal reflect that growth and expansion,” said Donna Wilcock, Ph.D., editor-in-chief, Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association. “Dr. Barnes’ clinical expertise complements the translational research focus of the current editorial staff. Her accomplishments in the epidemiology of aging and Alzheimer’s disease will help to expand the focus of the full suite of journals.”
Barnes received her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in biopsychology, and completed a postdoctoral fellowship in cognitive neuroscience at the University of California, Davis. She joined the faculty of RUSH as an assistant professor in 1999. She has received many NIH grants and has published close to 300 manuscripts. Her research interests include disparities in chronic diseases of aging, cognitive decline, and risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. She is the principal investigator of two longitudinal community-based studies of older African Americans, including the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS), which has been funded by NIA since 2004. She advocates for recruitment of under-represented groups into clinical studies and has received many awards and fellowships.
