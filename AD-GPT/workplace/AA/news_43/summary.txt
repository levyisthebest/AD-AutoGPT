The Alzheimer's Association is urging the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to reverse its decision to limit access to FDA-approved Alzheimer's disease treatments, arguing that it will harm patients and their families. The association provides resources and support for individuals with Alzheimer's and their caregivers, including educational programs, virtual events, and an online community for support. They also offer research, clinical trials, and funding opportunities for international dementia research, as well as opportunities for advocacy and philanthropy.
