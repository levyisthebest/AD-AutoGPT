NASHVILLE, November 14, 2022 — Siblings Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Ashley Williams and Jay Williams hosted the fifth annual Dance Party to End ALZ on Sunday, November 13 at Nashville’s Wildhorse Saloon. Apple Music's Beats 1 "Today's Country" radio host Kelleigh Bannen emceed the lively event, which raised $525,000 for the Alzheimer’s Association research grant program.
Dressed in ‘90s fashion, country artists took to the stage performing throwback hits from the era. Accompanied by Wildhorse Saloon’s house band Three Lane, performances included:
Brad Paisley’s renditions of “Liza Jane” and “Achy Breaky Heart”
Hot Country Knights’s vibrant versions of “T-R-O-U-B-L-E,” medley of 90s hits and “Man, I Feel Like A Woman”
Tracy Lawrence’s renditions of “Sticks and Stones,” “Time Marches On” and “Better Man, Better Off”
Jay Allen’s powerful take on “Should’ve Been a Cowboy”
Kelleigh Bannen’s throwback of “I Want You Back” with special guest *NSYNC’s Chris Kirkpatrick
Melinda Doolittle’s spin on the country classic “Boot Scootin’ Boogie”
Lindsay Ell’s powerful pop rendition of “Wannabe”
Charles Esten’s energetic version of “Smells Like Teen Spirit”
And a group finale and line dance to “Chattahoochee”
“For our fifth Dance Party to End ALZ, we raised $525,000, making it our most successful year to date!” said event founder Kimberly Williams-Paisley. “After losing our mom to Alzheimer’s six years ago, my siblings and I became relentless in our pursuit to advance Alzheimer’s research toward methods of treatment, prevention and ultimately, a cure. With the Alzheimer Association’s help, and the continued support of our generous sponsors, attendees, and performers, I know one day we will achieve our goal of a world without Alzheimer’s and all other dementia.”
Amid the '90s atmosphere, the Williams’ siblings joined on stage to encourage the crowd to support the cause, and shared their own family experience with their mom, Linda, who passed away with Alzheimer’s in 2016.
