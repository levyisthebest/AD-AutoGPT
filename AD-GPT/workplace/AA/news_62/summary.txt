The Alzheimer's Association has partnered with 100 Black Men of America to raise awareness and provide support for Alzheimer's disease in the African American community. The partnership will focus on education, outreach, and advocacy efforts to address the disproportionate impact of Alzheimer's on African Americans. The Alzheimer's Association provides resources and support for individuals with Alzheimer's and their caregivers, including diagnosis, treatments, legal and financial planning, caregiving, safety, and research. They also promote brain health and provide opportunities for advocacy and philanthropy.
