Brad Paisley, Dierks Bentley with Hot Country Knights, Tracy Lawrence, Kelleigh Bannen, Ashley Campbell, Melinda Doolittle, Lindsay Ell, Charles Esten, Chrissy Metz and special guests will perform classics from the '90s to raise funds to fight Alzheimer's and all other dementia
NASHVILLE, September 12, 2022 — Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Ashley Williams and Jay Williams will host the fifth annual star-studded ‘Dance Party to End ALZ’ in Nashville at the Wildhorse Saloon on Sunday, November 13. Apple Music's Beats 1 "Today's Country" radio host Kelleigh Bannen will serve as emcee for the event as well as perform.
This year’s lineup includes Brad Paisley, Dierks Bentley with Hot Country Knights, Tracy Lawrence, Kelleigh Bannen, Ashley Campbell, Melinda Doolittle, Lindsay Ell, Charles Esten, Chrissy Metz, and special guests. Nashville’s very own will take the stage to perform their favorite songs from the 1990’s to raise awareness and funds in the fight to end Alzheimer’s and all other dementia.
“For the past five years, Dance Party to End ALZ has been bringing people together to dress up, dance and experience great live music as some of the biggest names in country music sing cover songs from the ‘80s and ‘90s,” said Kimberly Williams-Paisley. “Most importantly, though, my siblings Ashley, Jay and I throw this event to help drive awareness and funds for a cause that affects millions of American families, including our own. To date, we’ve raised more than $1.3 million for the Alzheimer’s Association, helping fund research that is going to one day help lead us to a cure for this devastating disease.”
