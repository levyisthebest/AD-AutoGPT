Light exercise, including walking and stretching, can help preserve memory and reduce the risk of dementia in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, according to research presented at the 2022 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The study involved 296 sedentary or underactive participants aged between 65 and 89, who exercised for 30 minutes, four times a week for 52 weeks. The results showed no decline in cognitive function for both the moderate/hard exercisers and the low-intensity exercisers. Another study found that regular exercise, even at low intensity, can help prevent cognitive decline in people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
