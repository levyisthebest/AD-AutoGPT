Engaging in leisure activities such as reading, doing yoga, and spending time with loved ones can lower the risk of developing dementia, according to a study published in Neurology. The study reviewed 38 previous studies and found that mental activities, such as reading or writing for pleasure, had the most benefits, with people who engaged in these activities having a 23% lower risk of dementia. Lifestyle changes such as eating a heart-healthy diet, exercising regularly, and staying cognitively engaged can also reduce the risk of dementia.
