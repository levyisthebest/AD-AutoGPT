A study in Argentina found that loss of smell, a common COVID-19 symptom, may be linked to long-term brain decline. Two-thirds of those who had COVID-19 had functional memory impairment, which was severe in half of them. The severity of anosmia predicted cognitive impairment, and cognitive problems existed a year after illness, but it is too soon to tell if it is permanent. Further research is needed to understand this correlation and develop a means to prevent brain damage.
