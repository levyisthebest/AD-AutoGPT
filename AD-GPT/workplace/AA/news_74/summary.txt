Black and Hispanic patients with dementia are less likely to use hospice care at the end of life and more likely to use emergency department and inpatient services, according to a study of Medicare beneficiaries. These groups also incur more inpatient costs compared to white patients. The study did not identify the reason for the racial gap, but previous studies have suggested culture, religious or spiritual values, and mistrust of the healthcare system due to medical racism and health inequalities in the US as possible explanations. The study calls for policies that match treatment to patient preferences.
