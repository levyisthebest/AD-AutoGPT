A study has found that consuming highly processed foods is linked to accelerated cognitive decline, with cognitive test scores for memory and executive function declining the most for those who ate the most highly processed foods. Highly processed foods tend to be less nutritious and contain added sugar, salt, fat, and artificial preservatives. A heart-healthy lifestyle promotes a healthier brain and helps preserve cognitive function.
