Eating ultra-processed foods for more than 20% of daily calorie intake can lead to a 28% faster decline in cognitive scores, according to a study presented at the 2022 Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The study was conducted on 10,775 people over eight years and found that ultra-processed foods contain large quantities of fats, sugar, salt, artificial flavors/colors, stabilizers, and/or preservatives, which are linked to cognitive decline and an increased risk of developing dementia. To cut back on processed foods, consider making small changes with budget-friendly grocery options.
