Regular physical activity, such as walking, can help slow down memory loss in older adults and reduce the risk of cognitive decline, according to a recent study presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The study involved nearly 300 sedentary adults with mild cognitive impairment who were split into two groups: one engaged in aerobic exercise and the other in stretching and balance exercises. Both groups showed no signs of cognitive decline after 12 months. The EXERT trial, the largest and longest study on the impact of exercise on mild cognitive impairment, found that both intensive and less-intensive exercise groups had brain benefits, possibly due to the socialization aspect of the exercise.
