The Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2022 presented new research on Alzheimer's and dementia, including prevention strategies, clinical trials, and the impact of COVID-19 on memory and thinking skills. Studies found that physical activity, T3D-959 drug, and positive life changes during the pandemic may protect against cognitive decline, while experiences of racism, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, ICU stays, and high consumption of ultra-processed foods may increase the risk of dementia and memory decline. Lower socioeconomic status and persistent low wages were also linked to a higher risk of dementia.
