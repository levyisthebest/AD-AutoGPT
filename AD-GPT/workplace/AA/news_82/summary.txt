High blood pressure disorders during pregnancy, such as chronic/gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, are linked to an increased risk of vascular dementia and accelerated brain aging, according to studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. Women with a history of these disorders were more likely to develop vascular dementia later in life, and high blood pressure during pregnancy was associated with white matter pathology, a predictor of cognitive decline. Early detection and treatment of these disorders are crucial to protect both the pregnant person and baby.
