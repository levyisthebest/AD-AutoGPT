New research presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference has found that women who experience high blood pressure during pregnancy are at an increased risk of developing vascular dementia and accelerated brain aging. Women with a history of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy were more likely to develop vascular dementia compared to those with normal pregnancies. Additionally, high blood pressure during pregnancy was associated with white matter pathology, a predictor of accelerated cognitive decline, for up to 15 years after pregnancy. Women with a history of severe preeclampsia have significantly higher concentrations of beta-amyloid-positive extracellular vesicles, a protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. These findings suggest that women with a history of HDP or preeclampsia should be evaluated and treated early for hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.
