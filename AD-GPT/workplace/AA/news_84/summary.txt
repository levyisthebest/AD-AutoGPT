The Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2022 presented new research on Alzheimer's and dementia, covering topics such as aging, risk factors, prevention strategies, and caregiving. The conference attracted over 9,500 attendees and featured more than 4,000 scientific presentations. The Alzheimer's Association highlighted results from clinical trials, including the EXERT Study and T3D Therapeutics' Phase 2 trial of T3D-959. The conference also announced the launch of ALZ-NET, a network that will collect long-term clinical and safety data from patients treated with FDA-approved Alzheimerâ€™s disease therapies. Studies presented at the conference found that experiences of racism, hypertensive disorders during pregnancy, persistent loss of smell due to COVID-19, ICU stays, and high consumption of ultra-processed foods are all linked to increased dementia risk and cognitive decline.
