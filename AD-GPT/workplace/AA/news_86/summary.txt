Studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2022 have linked lower socioeconomic status to higher dementia risk, lower cognitive performance, and faster memory decline. Socioeconomic conditions and genetic risk interact to determine the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Lower-quality neighborhood resources and difficulty paying for basic needs were associated with lower cognitive test scores among Black and Latino individuals. Higher parental socioeconomic status was associated with increased resilience to the negative effects of Alzheimer's marker ptau-181, better baseline executive function, and slower cognitive decline in older age. Policies aimed at improving financial well-being and access to education and healthcare could help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias.
