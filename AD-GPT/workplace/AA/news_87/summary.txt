The Alzheimer's Association presented results from various clinical trials at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2022, highlighting the importance of a diverse treatment pipeline for achieving their vision of a world without Alzheimer's. The EXERT Study showed that regular physical activity may protect brain cells against damage. The Association is working towards effective combination therapies for dementia treatment and risk reduction, including the U.S. POINTER Study and T3D-959. Results from phase 3 clinical trials for two anti-amyloid compounds are expected before the end of 2022. The Alzheimer's Association has launched the Alzheimer's Network for Treatment and Diagnostic (ALZ-NET) to collect long-term clinical and safety data from patients treated with FDA-approved Alzheimer's therapies in real-world clinical settings. Future treatments for Alzheimer's will need to address amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, and other brain changes.
