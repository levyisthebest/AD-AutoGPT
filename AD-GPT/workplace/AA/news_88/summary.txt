Eating ultra-processed foods for more than 20% of your caloric intake may lead to cognitive decline, especially in memory and executive function, according to a study presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. The study followed 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years and defined ultra-processed foods as those with significant industrial processes and high quantities of fats, sugar, salt, artificial flavors/colors, stabilizers, and/or preservatives. To counteract this decline, experts suggest a heart-healthy, balanced diet low in processed foods and high in whole nutritional foods. Lifestyle changes such as exercise, good sleep, cognitive engagement, head injury protection, not smoking, and managing heart health may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline.
