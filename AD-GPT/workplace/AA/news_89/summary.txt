New research has found that consuming ultra-processed foods, such as instant noodles and sugary drinks, can lead to cognitive decline and a faster rate of cognitive decline. The study followed over 6,000 people for a decade and found that those who consumed 20% or more of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods had worse cognitive function over time. Experts warn that these foods are not good for overall health and can lead to a shorter lifespan. However, incorporating dairy, eggs, and ground meat as sources of quality protein can help maintain a healthy diet.
