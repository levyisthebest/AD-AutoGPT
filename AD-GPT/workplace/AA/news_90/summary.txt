New research suggests that even simple exercise may help prevent memory problems in aging brains, particularly in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. A government-funded study found that after a year of aerobic exercises or stretching-and-balance moves, cognitive testing showed no worsening and brain scans did not show shrinkage. Regular physical activity may reduce damaging inflammation and increase blood flow to the brain. Social stimulation also helped older adults stick to an exercise routine. The study's lead researcher is conducting a larger study to see if combining exercise with other healthy habits can reduce the risk of dementia.
