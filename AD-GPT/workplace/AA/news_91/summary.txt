New research suggests that experiencing racism can lead to negative effects on cognitive function and mental health, including declining memory in middle age. Black adults are especially at risk, as they are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's disease or other related dementias as whites. Racism is a form of trauma that leads to increased stress, which can result in negative biological changes such as inflammation, a known risk factor for cognitive difficulties, including dementia. Addressing and combating racism is important for overall well-being and decreasing the risk of cognitive impairment later in life.
