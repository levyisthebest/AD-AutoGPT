Scientists are shifting their focus from targeting amyloid plaques to other potential causes of Alzheimer's disease, such as brain inflammation and conditions related to diabetes. T3D Therapeutics shared new phase 2 trial data for an experimental non-amyloid drug, called T3D-959, that aims to overcome insulin resistance in Alzheimer's patients. Exercise has been found to stall cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients. Blood-based tests are being developed to predict the presence of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Researcher Selkoe is calling for more research into treatments that target tangled tau proteins and the activation of microglia. More research discoveries are expected to show potential for slowing Alzheimer's disease within the next year or two.
