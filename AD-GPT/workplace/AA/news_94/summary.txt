Researchers at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference are exploring new potential causes of impaired memory and thinking beyond the traditional focus on amyloid plaques and tau fibers. They are looking at cell vulnerability early on in the disease, before the development of plaques and tangles. A team of researchers has created an Alzheimer's atlas by analyzing more than a million cells from 84 brains donated by people who had signed up for Alzheimer's research projects. The atlas provides a better understanding of the brain and its changes in Alzheimer's, including vulnerable neurons and inflammation. The team hopes the atlas will be used to develop new treatments for Alzheimer's. Additionally, a substance found in young spinal fluid has been found to help old mice remember, and scientists are looking to people with Down syndrome to test Alzheimer's drugs.
