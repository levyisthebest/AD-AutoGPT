A study presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that consuming highly processed foods may be linked to a faster rate of cognitive decline. The study examined the diets and cognition of over 10,000 middle-aged and older adults in Brazil and found a correlation between those who consumed 20% or more of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods and a faster decline in cognitive performance. Lower socioeconomic status can lead to limited access to healthy foods, which can affect physical and cognitive health. It is recommended to build meals around whole foods to prevent cognitive decline.
