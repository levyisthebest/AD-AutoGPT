The Alzheimer's Association has launched ALZ-NET, a platform that will collect real-world clinical data from patients treated with FDA-approved Alzheimer’s disease therapies. The goal is to improve patient care and outcomes, inform treatment practices, and track how people from all backgrounds respond to therapies. ALZ-NET will include a variety of populations to achieve representativeness beyond those historically enrolled in clinical trials. The network will build on expertise and contacts developed through the Alzheimer’s Association-led IDEAS and New IDEAS studies. The Alzheimer's Association International Conference is the largest gathering of researchers focused on Alzheimer's and other dementias.
