Studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that experiencing racism and discrimination is associated with lower memory scores and cognitive decline in older adults, particularly among Black individuals. Chronic exposure to racism and discrimination can increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. The studies highlight the need to address systemic racism and discrimination to reduce health disparities and improve brain health.
