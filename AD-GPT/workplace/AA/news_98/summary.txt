Studies presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference found that experiences of structural, interpersonal, and institutional racism are linked to lower memory scores and worse cognition in midlife and old age, particularly among Black individuals. Multilevel racism contributes to cognitive decline among marginalized communities, with workplace discrimination being associated with higher levels of baseline cognition and wide-ranging discrimination being associated with worse semantic memory at baseline. Discrimination has a lasting impact on cognitive health among the oldest old, even after accounting for experiences of major lifetime discrimination. The findings highlight the need to identify and reduce racism and other forms of discrimination to achieve health equity.
