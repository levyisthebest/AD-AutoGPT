Alzheimer's disease is linked to certain genes, including risk genes and deterministic genes, with APOE e4 increasing the risk and APOE e2 reducing it. Other genes have also been linked to the disease, but genes are only risk factors and not causes, as lifestyle, race, ethnicity, and environment also play a role. Genetic testing for Alzheimer's disease is not routinely recommended, but may be helpful for certain treatments and for individuals with early-onset Alzheimer's or a family history of the disease. Researchers are still studying genes that affect the risk of Alzheimer's and those that may protect against it.
