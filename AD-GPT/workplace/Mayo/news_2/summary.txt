Alzheimer's disease is no longer considered just an end-stage disease, and a combination of genetics and environmental factors play a role. Biomarkers such as blood and spinal fluid tests can give clues as to what's going on in the brain, and high tech imaging allows for monitoring of changes in the physical structure and chemical functions of the brain in relation to Alzheimer's disease.
