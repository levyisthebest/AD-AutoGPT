Current Alzheimer's treatments only temporarily improve symptoms and do not stop the underlying decline of brain cells. Future treatments may involve a combination of medicines targeting clumps of the protein beta-amyloid and reducing the amount of beta-amyloid formed in the brain. Researchers are also studying various approaches to treating Alzheimer's disease, including investigating the role of chronic brain cell inflammation, insulin resistance, the heart-head connection, hormones, and developing new medicines. Lifestyle choices such as exercise and a heart-healthy diet may also help prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease.
