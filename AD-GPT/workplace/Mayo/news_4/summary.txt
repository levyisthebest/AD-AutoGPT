Alzheimer's dementia can be diagnosed through a doctor's exam, which includes tests to assess memory impairment, thinking skills, functional abilities, and behavior changes. An accurate diagnosis is important for appropriate treatment, care, family education, and future planning. Early signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's dementia include memory impairment. Additional tests may be ordered to rule out other conditions and assess memory problems. A cerebrospinal fluid examination and brain imaging tests can help diagnose Alzheimer's disease, but new tests are being developed to diagnose the disease earlier. An early diagnosis can help manage symptoms and plan for the future.
