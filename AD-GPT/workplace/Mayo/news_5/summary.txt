The National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association have updated the research definition of Alzheimer's disease dementia to include a biological definition that can be detected through biomarkers in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. This change allows for earlier diagnosis and better treatment options. The new definition only applies to clinical trials and research and does not affect how a person is diagnosed in a healthcare provider's office.
