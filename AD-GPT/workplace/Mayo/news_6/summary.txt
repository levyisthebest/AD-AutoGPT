Alzheimer's disease progresses slowly and affects various areas of the brain, leading to five stages of the disease. These stages include preclinical Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, moderate dementia, and severe dementia. Biomarkers and genetic tests can help diagnose the disease, and individuals require increasing assistance with daily activities as the disease progresses. The rate of progression varies, but on average, people with Alzheimer's disease live between three and 11 years after diagnosis, with pneumonia being a common cause of death.
