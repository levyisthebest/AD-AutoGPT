Two types of drugs, cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, can help manage symptoms of Alzheimer's disease but may lose effectiveness over time. Ongoing research is being conducted to develop more effective drugs, and clinical trials may be an option for those who cannot take approved medications or do not see improvement with them. Aducanumab is the first drug of its kind for Alzheimer's disease, but its benefits on daily functioning, thinking, or memory are unclear, and it can cause side effects such as brain swelling and bleeding. Lecanemab has shown promise in slowing cognitive decline in people with early Alzheimer's disease and is under review by the FDA.
