Research from the National Institute on Aging has found that having a good sense of smell is linked to slower loss of brain volume and cognitive decline in older adults. The study suggests that sense of smell may be an early biomarker of cognitive decline and future studies with longer follow-ups may help researchers better understand the role of specific brain regions in this association.
