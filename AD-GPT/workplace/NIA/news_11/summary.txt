A study funded by the National Institute on Aging found that neurons in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease accumulate more DNA changes than those without the disease, suggesting a link between genomic damage to neurons and the development of Alzheimer's. The study provides insight into the processes contributing to DNA changes in Alzheimer's and may lead to new targets for treatment and prevention.
