The investigational drug solanezumab, developed by Eli Lilly and Company, did not slow cognitive decline or prevent the accumulation of brain beta-amyloid in cognitively healthy people at risk for memory loss and problems with thinking due to Alzheimer's disease, according to a phase 3 clinical trial supported by the National Institute on Aging. The study's results may help improve Alzheimer's disease and related dementias prevention and treatment strategies. The full report of the data will be presented at a scientific meeting later this year.
