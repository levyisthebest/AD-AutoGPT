Hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has been found to lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in people with the condition. It has also shown promise in reducing inflammation and abnormal protein buildup in mouse and cell models of Alzheimer's. These findings could lead to clinical trials to test its effectiveness in preventing dementia in older adults.
