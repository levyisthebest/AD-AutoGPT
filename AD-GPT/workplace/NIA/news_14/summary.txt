The National Institute on Aging will be attending the On Aging 2023 conference in Atlanta and invites attendees to visit their exhibit booth to meet staff, explore new publications, and learn about the institute. They are also encouraging those who use their materials or are funded by them to take a photo with their booth and share it on social media with the hashtags #NIAfunded or #NIHAging.
