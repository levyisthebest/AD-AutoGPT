A study led by NIH's Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias found associations between hospitalization for viral illnesses and six different neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. The study found 45 associations between viruses and neurodegenerative diseases, with the strongest association being between viral encephalitis and Alzheimer's disease. The researchers suggest that vaccination against certain viruses may reduce the risk of these conditions.
