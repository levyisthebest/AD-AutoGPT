A study by the National Institute on Aging found that higher levels of mitochondrial DNA molecules in a person's blood are linked to certain personality traits and a longer lifespan. Participants with higher mitochondrial DNA had lower incidence of neuroticism and depression, and higher levels of extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The study adds to the growing evidence that mitochondrial DNA levels may be involved in the development of psychological conditions and longevity.
