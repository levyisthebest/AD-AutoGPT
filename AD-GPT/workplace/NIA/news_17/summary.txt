Researchers have discovered molecules that can enter the brain and dismantle tau tangles, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. These molecules work similarly to EGCG, a compound found in green tea, but can penetrate the brain more easily. The molecules were tested in cell models and brain samples from Alzheimer's patients, and several were found to untangle tau fibers and prevent the formation of new tangles. The findings suggest that these molecules could be a promising strategy for treating Alzheimer's.
