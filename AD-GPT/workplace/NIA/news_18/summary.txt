Exposure to poor economic conditions during the Great Depression in utero may lead to accelerated aging in later life, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. Prenatal exposure to adverse environmental factors may lead to epigenetic changes that influence biological aging later in life. The study found that people exposed to worse economic conditions during fetal development were more likely to have a biological age older than their chronological age, suggesting that fetal development may be important in laying the foundation for longevity and healthy aging.
