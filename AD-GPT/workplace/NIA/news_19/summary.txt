Research funded by the National Institute on Aging has found that estimating the onset of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain can help predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Three algorithms were developed and tested using PET brain scans to model the process of amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. The study found that APOE e4 is associated with lower age of amyloid onset and decreased time from amyloid onset to cognitive impairment. Further research is needed to understand the impact of using different PET scanners and different methods of interpreting PET scans to measure amyloid accumulation.
