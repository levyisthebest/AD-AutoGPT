Research is being conducted on the potential benefits of music on healthy aging, including its effects on memory, emotions, and the brain and body as we age. Studies are being conducted on the use of music to reduce patient delirium in the ICU, soothe sleep in people living with dementia, and reduce agitation and aggression. Music can help revive learning and memory functions in older adults with memory impairments and enhance social networks to reduce isolation and loneliness. Two studies are exploring the potential therapeutic benefits of music, including singing in a choir and listening to carefully sequenced music while in the ICU. More research is needed to understand the cognitive, social, and psychological mechanisms by which music can impact health and well-being.
