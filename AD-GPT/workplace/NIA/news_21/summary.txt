A study led by Dr. Christoph Thaiss found that the makeup of the gut microbiome in mice predicted their exercise performance better than genetic, metabolic, or behavioral traits. Gut microbes produce compounds that stimulate sensory neurons in the gut, leading to increased dopamine levels in the striatum during exercise, enhancing the desire for exercise. The findings suggest that the motivation to exercise may depend on the state of the gut microbiome and could offer an effective way to boost people's levels of exercise to improve public health generally.
