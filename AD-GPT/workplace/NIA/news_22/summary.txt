Three studies suggest that viral infections may increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. The studies found significant associations between previous viral infections and neurodegenerative disease diagnoses, with the strongest risk association being between viral encephalitis and Alzheimer's disease. The studies also suggest that existing vaccinations may help reduce the risk or severity of viral illnesses and may mitigate the risks of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the risks of being diagnosed with a neurodegenerative disorder were high within one year of a viral infection, but only six out of 16 associations remained significant if the infection happened five to 15 years before the diagnosis.
