Researchers funded by the National Institute on Aging have identified changes in the microbiome of the skin, mouth, and gut that occur with aging and may contribute to age-related diseases. The skin microbiome may be particularly important in understanding age-related health conditions. The study provides a foundation for future research and establishes the microbiome as a possible target for treatments and strategies to prevent age-related health conditions.
