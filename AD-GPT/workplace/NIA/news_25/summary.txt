A blood test called SOBA has been developed by researchers at the University of Washington that can detect toxic beta-amyloid oligomers, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, even before cognitive impairment occurs. The test could allow for early disease diagnosis and intervention before irreparable brain damage occurs.
