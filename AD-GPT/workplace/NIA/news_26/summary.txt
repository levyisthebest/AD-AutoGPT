Telmisartan, a blood pressure medication, did not improve walking performance in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the legs, according to a study. However, exercise was found to improve walking distance. The study did not include patients already taking telmisartan or similar drugs, and future research could explore the effectiveness of blood pressure drugs in PAD patients without high blood pressure.
