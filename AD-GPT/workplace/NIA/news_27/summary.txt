Sensory loss, such as vision and hearing, may be related to dementia and overall brain health in older adults. Researchers are studying the relationship between the eyes and the brain through the NIA-funded Eye Determinants of Cognition (EyeDOC) Study and developing non-invasive and cost-effective methods for early screening of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease using the retina. Untreated vision and hearing loss can lead to social isolation, reduced physical activity, and cognitive decline, with hearing loss being ranked as the single largest potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia.
