The FDA has granted accelerated approval for lecanemab, a drug developed by Eisai and Biogen, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease based on the results of a phase 3 clinical trial. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is awaiting the publication of data on lecanemab and is currently funding three trials to evaluate its effectiveness in treating different types of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. NIA-funded scientists will continue to identify and test new dementia drug candidates and improve the understanding of the role of genetics and other disease mechanisms.
