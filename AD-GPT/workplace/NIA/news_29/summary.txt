A study of data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) has found that differences in education and early life nutrition may explain why women have worse late-life cognition than men. The study suggests that education during adolescence and young adulthood may be critical for cognitive health later in life. Additionally, where there are high levels of gender inequality, the data indicate that women must reach a higher level of education to reach the same level of late-life cognition as men. The study found that early life socioeconomic nutrition and education explain up to 74% of the female disadvantage in cognition.
