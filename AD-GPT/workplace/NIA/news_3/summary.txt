A study funded by the National Institute on Aging has found that removing the APOE ε4 gene from neurons in mice reduces the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The study suggests that the activity of the APOE ε4 gene in neurons promotes the development of Alzheimer's. The research provides new insights into potential therapeutic targets for APOE ε4-related Alzheimer’s and helps illustrate how APOE ε4 is involved in many of the characteristics of the disease.
