The National Institute on Aging will host a virtual research summit on care, services, and supports for persons with dementia and their caregivers in March 2023. The summit aims to review research progress, highlight innovative research, and identify remaining unmet research needs. Key themes include detection and diagnosis, dementia care models, healthcare access disparities, caregiver support, and economic implications. The summit will gather input to inform federal agencies, foundations, and private sector organizations. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health provides resources and updates on various health topics, including the potential for "musical medicine" to influence healthy aging.
