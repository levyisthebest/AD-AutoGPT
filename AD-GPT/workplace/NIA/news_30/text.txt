2023 National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers

On March 20-22, 2023, NIA will host the National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers. This event will be held virtually.
The Summit will review research progress, highlight innovative and promising research, and identify remaining unmet research needs with input from the research community, persons living with dementia and their care partners, those who provide healthcare or services and supports to persons living with dementia, and other stakeholders. The 2023 Summit aims to expand on what was learned from previous Dementia Care Summits: the 2020 Virtual Meeting Series and the first National Research Summit on Care, Services, and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers in 2017. Each summit provides an opportunity for individuals to share perspectives about critical scientific gaps and opportunities that reflect critical scientific priorities for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias research. Through the upcoming summit, NIA will gather input to help inform federal agencies, foundations, and private sector organizations.
Key themes at this year’s summit include:
What Matters Framework and Living Well with Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias
Impact of Detection and Diagnosis on Individuals and Care Partners
Dementia Care Models and Coordination of Care
Disparities in Health Care Access, Utilization, and Quality
Support for Care Partners and Caregivers
Dementia Care Workforce
Economic Impacts, Implications, and Approaches
Approaches to Participatory Research and Diverse Recruitment and Retention
The Summit plenary talk is titled “Improving the Rigor, Reproducibility, and Opportunity for Dissemination of Interventions for Persons Living with Dementia and their Care Partners.”
