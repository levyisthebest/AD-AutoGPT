A protein called Imp-L2, produced in the ovaries of reproductive ants, suppresses the insulin pathway that controls aging, leading to increased fertility and longevity. The study focused on a species of ant called Harpegnathos saltator, where queens live for approximately five years, while nonreproductive workers have a lifespan of around seven months. The research offers insight into longevity research for humans.
