A study funded by the National Institute on Aging found that older adults with advanced heart failure report differences in quality of life based on their pending surgical treatment options. The study examined quality of life up to two years after surgeries to see how each treatment affected it, which will help guide shared decision-making discussions about the best surgical options for older patients with heart failure. The study provides important information for doctors and patients to make informed decisions about their care.
