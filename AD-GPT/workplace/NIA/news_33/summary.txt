A study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease have similar levels of amyloid plaques in their brains as those with hereditary, early-onset Alzheimer's. This suggests that individuals with Down syndrome may benefit from participating in studies on Alzheimer's therapies aimed at slowing the formation of amyloid plaques. The NIH is a federal agency that conducts and supports medical research to investigate the causes, treatments, and cures for diseases.
