The APOE4 gene, which increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, affects gene expression in all brain cell types and impairs the ability of oligodendrocytes to produce healthy myelin sheaths around nerve fibers. This is due to abnormal cholesterol accumulation within the cells, but can be reversed with a drug called cyclodextrin. These findings could lead to new treatments for Alzheimer's.
