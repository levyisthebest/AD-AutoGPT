Researchers at the National Institute on Aging have discovered blood biomarkers that can help detect cognitive impairment in people with Parkinson's disease. The extracellular vesicle biomarkers can identify whether an individual with Parkinson's has cognitive impairment by measuring proteins such as alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, phosphorylated tau, and an insulin-signaling protein called Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS-1). These findings could improve timely diagnosis and treatment for Parkinson's patients with cognitive impairment.
