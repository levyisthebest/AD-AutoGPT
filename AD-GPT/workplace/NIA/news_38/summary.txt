Immune cells called PBMs regulate the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, removing waste and debris. When PBMs are depleted, cerebrospinal fluid flow is reduced and proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease build up. Aged mice and those with Alzheimer's have fewer PBMs and more extracellular matrix accumulation. Boosting PBMs could potentially slow neurodegenerative diseases.
