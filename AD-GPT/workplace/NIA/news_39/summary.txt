A new measurement system based on observable traits can identify individuals at risk for adverse health outcomes based on their computed "aging score." Individuals with higher biological aging scores exhibited faster physical and cognitive decline, developed multiple health conditions, and had shorter lifespans. The approach may be a better predictor of health outcomes over time than the traditional focus on a person's chronological age. The study used data from nearly 1,000 people aged 24 to 93 and was published in Nature Aging. The next step is to link the phenotypic-aging score with cellular and molecular measurements to enhance understanding of the biology of aging. The research was supported by NIA grants.
