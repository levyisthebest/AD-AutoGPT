A study by the National Institute on Aging has found that people with less myelin in their brains experience steeper declines in cognition over time. The study suggests that myelin content could be a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans to measure myelin content in the brains of 123 cognitively unimpaired adults. Lower myelin content is associated with more rapid cognitive decline among cognitively unimpaired individuals, and future research should explore the link between myelin and cognition in people with neurodegenerative diseases.
