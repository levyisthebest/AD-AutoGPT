Improved eye care could have prevented up to 100,000 cases of dementia in the US, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. Correcting vision problems through eye exams, eyeglasses, and cataract surgery was found to be one of the top preventive actions to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's and related dementias. The study also found that 1.8% of US dementia cases were associated with visual impairment, with projections that this figure would rise to around 250,000 cases by 2050. Additional studies are needed to test if addressing correctable vision problems can be an effective intervention to protect cognitive health.
