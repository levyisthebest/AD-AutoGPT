NIH releases 2022 dementia research progress report
November 08, 2022
Alzheimer's Disease
NIH has released Advancing Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Research for All Populations: Prevent. Diagnose. Treat. Care. (PDF, 17M), a 2022 scientific progress report.
The report features science advances and related efforts made between March 2021 and early 2022 in areas including drug development, lifestyle interventions, biomarker research, and more. It provides a comprehensive overview of the meaningful progress researchers are making to address the enormous health care challenges of Alzheimer’s and related dementia diseases.
This year’s progress report was preceded by the Fiscal Year 2024 Professional Judgment Budget for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias, announced in late July. Looking Forward: Opportunities to Accelerate Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias Research (PDF, 9M) provides an estimate of the funds needed to enable NIH to fully pursue scientific opportunities to inform effective prevention, treatment, and care of those living with these diseases.
Over the past year, NIH has conducted and funded remarkable Alzheimer’s and related dementias research that is bringing us closer to effective prevention, diagnostics, and treatments and improved care for the people living with these conditions, along with better support for care partners. With continued federal support and collaboration among researchers, clinicians, people living with dementia, and their care partners and families, the future holds hope and promise.
