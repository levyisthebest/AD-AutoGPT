A study funded by the National Institute on Aging has found a possible genetic link between brain blood vessel damage and Alzheimer's disease. The gene FMNL2 may play a critical role in linking risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity to the brain damage seen in some cases of Alzheimer's disease. The study suggests that FMNL2 helps reshape a protective barrier between the brain and blood vessels, which may speed the removal of damaging proteins. The findings support the theory that Alzheimer's is, in many ways, a blood vessel disorder. Additionally, the National Institute on Aging has set two research implementation milestones to enable precision medicine research and create new research programs to better understand the mechanism of vulnerability and resilience in Alzheimer's disease.
