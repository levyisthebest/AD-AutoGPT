C₂N Diagnostics has developed a blood test, PrecivityAD™, that can diagnose Alzheimer's disease without the need for invasive and expensive procedures. The test identifies beta-amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, and can also monitor disease progression and treatment response. The National Institute on Aging supported C₂N Diagnostics in developing the test, which is now available to doctors across the US and being used in clinical trials to test new Alzheimer's treatments. The test holds the potential to accelerate Alzheimer's research and improve patient outcomes.
