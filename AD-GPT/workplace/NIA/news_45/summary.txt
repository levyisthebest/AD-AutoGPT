Researchers at Case Western Reserve University have identified a molecule called USP11 in the brain that may contribute to the higher risk of Alzheimer's disease in women. The molecule removes recycling tags from tau protein, leading to the formation of tau tangles, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The gene USP11, found on the X chromosome, is associated with tau tangles in the brain and is more strongly associated with tau tangles in female brains than in male brains. Mice engineered to lack the gene that produces USP11 had substantially less tau tangles, and the researchers hope to develop a medicine that inhibits USP11 to protect women from the higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
