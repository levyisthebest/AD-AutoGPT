Two recent studies have found no evidence to support the use of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as Viagra and Cialis, for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The studies examined insurance claims data from Medicare beneficiaries and data on over 13,000 people with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The results do not support earlier findings that suggested a potential link between PDE5 inhibitors and a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. The search for effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease continues.
