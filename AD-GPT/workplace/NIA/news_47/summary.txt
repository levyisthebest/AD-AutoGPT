The National Institute on Aging is funding research to understand the effects of extreme weather and natural disasters on older adults, who are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of these events. The aim is to improve their resilience, preparedness, and recovery from disasters. Disruption of regular health care during disasters can have serious consequences for older adults with chronic diseases, and research is being conducted to promote healthy aging in affected communities. Certain medications may increase heat sensitivity in older adults, making them more vulnerable to heat-related hospitalizations. Scientists are also studying why some older adults are more resilient than others during disasters.
