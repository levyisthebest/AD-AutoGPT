Workshop: The Cancer-Alzheimer’s disease nexus: Exploring relationships, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications
October 18, 2022
Alzheimer's Disease
On October 18 and 19, 2022, the National Institute on Aging (NIA) will sponsor a 2-day virtual workshop on Alzheimer’s Disease and Cancer.  Recent research has suggested a complex relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and cancers.  Several potential mechanisms have been proposed and warrant further investigation. Understanding the intersection of the underlying causes and biology for these two distinct families of diseases with one another may offer novel approaches to identify new therapeutic approaches and possible opportunities to repurpose existing drug candidates.
The goal of this 2-day workshop is to identify research gaps and opportunities, inform scientific priorities, and determine possible future directions for research in this area. We look forward to exploring the state of the science, as well as the opportunities and challenges, in areas such as:
The link between cancer and Alzheimer’s Disease
Genes, Mechanisms, and Epidemiological Evidence
Cancer Chemotherapy and Cognitive Dysfunction
Meds, Mechanisms, and Drug Repurposing
