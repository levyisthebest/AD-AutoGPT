Increased financial generosity in older adults may be an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. The study found that willingness to give away money was associated with decreased cognitive function, and that problems with managing money and financial decision-making may be among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease. This information could help protect older adults from financial mismanagement and abuse, and physicians may use this knowledge to improve their screenings for Alzheimer's.
