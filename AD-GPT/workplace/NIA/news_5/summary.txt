A study funded by the National Institute on Aging found that the MIND and Mediterranean diets, which are plant-based and rich in brain-healthy nutrients, are associated with fewer signs of Alzheimer's disease in older adults. The study involved 581 participants who agreed to donate their brains for dementia research and found that green leafy vegetables were particularly beneficial. Adherence to these diets may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's. The study suggests that diet is an important lifestyle factor that needs further research.
