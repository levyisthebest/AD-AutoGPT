Female red deer become less social and move to smaller, isolated areas as they age, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. The study analyzed 46 years of social connection data on a wild population of European female red deer and found age-related declines in social network measures. The changes were driven by spatial and social behavioral changes by individual deer rather than by changes in the deer population. The study provides insights into the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to social connections in aging animals and prompts questions for future research on the factors that affect human social connections in aging.
