A study led by Wake Forest University School of Medicine found that a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement may improve cognition in older adults, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular disease. The study examined over 2,200 participants aged 65 and older who were given a cocoa extract supplement and/or a multivitamin-mineral supplement daily for three years, or an inactive placebo for comparison. The researchers caution that more research is needed before recommending daily multivitamin supplementation to prevent cognitive decline.
