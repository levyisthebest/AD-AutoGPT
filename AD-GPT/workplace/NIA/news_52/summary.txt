The National Institute on Aging is funding research on the science of behavior change to help people adopt and maintain healthy habits. The SOBC Research Network is dedicated to discovering the key mechanisms underlying successful behavior change through an experimental medicine approach. The Science of Behavior Change program aims to connect basic scientists and intervention scientists to develop successful behavioral change interventions. The program has identified three domains that show promise as mechanisms of behavior change: self-regulation, stress reactivity and coping, and social support. Delay discounting, a self-regulation mechanism, is a way to quantify how much an individual weighs smaller, short-term rewards versus larger, long-term rewards. Researchers are exploring the concept of delay discounting as a mechanism for improving health behavior, and several interventions have led to improved decision-making.
