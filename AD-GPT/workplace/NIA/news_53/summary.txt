A study published in Nature Neuroscience has identified 44 groups of proteins that show coordinated changes in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease but not in a control group. The study highlights the importance of directly analyzing proteins along with RNA to gain a more complete picture of how Alzheimer's may damage the brain. The researchers plan to use these results to develop new diagnostic tests and treatments for Alzheimer's.
