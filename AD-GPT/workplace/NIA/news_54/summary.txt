Researchers funded by the National Institute on Aging have used electronic medical records to identify key differences in pathology and clinical characteristics between men and women with Alzheimer's disease, as well as between individuals with and without the disease. The study found that people with Alzheimer's were more likely to be diagnosed with certain medical conditions and that there were differences between men and women with the disease. The study demonstrates the potential of a "big data" approach involving advanced computer algorithms to identify associations and sex-specific differences in diagnoses, medications, and laboratory test results.
