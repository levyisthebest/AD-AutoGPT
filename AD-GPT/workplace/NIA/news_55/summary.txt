A report by the US Census Bureau, supported by the National Institute on Aging, found that over 3 million adults aged 65 and older move every year, with southern and western states being the most popular destinations. This data could be useful for community planning and policymaking. The NIA, an official website of the National Institutes of Health, offers resources and updates on aging-related issues.
