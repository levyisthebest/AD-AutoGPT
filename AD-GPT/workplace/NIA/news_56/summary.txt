Leisure activities such as running, cycling, swimming, and walking may improve longevity for older adults, according to a study by NIH researchers. The study analyzed data from over 272,000 participants and found that all types of recreational activities that get people moving are associated with greater longevity. Running was associated with the greatest risk reduction for death from cancer, while racquet sports were associated with the greatest risk reduction for death from heart disease. Those who met the recommended guidelines for physical activity had a 13% lower risk of death compared to inactive participants.
