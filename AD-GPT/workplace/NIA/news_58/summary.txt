Non-invasive brain stimulation using high-definition transcranial alternating current stimulation (HD-tACS) can improve short-term working memory and long-term memory in older adults, according to a study involving 150 volunteers aged 65 to 88. Low-frequency stimulation to the parietal region improved short-term working memory, while high-frequency stimulation to the prefrontal cortex improved long-term memory. The study suggests that non-invasive techniques can modify specific brain rhythms and improve cognitive function in older adults, but further research is needed to determine the long-term effects and potential benefits for individuals with impaired cognition or at risk for dementia.
