A study funded by the National Institute on Aging found that a combination of declining cognitive function and slowed walking speed is a better predictor of dementia risk in older adults than either factor alone. The study recommends adding walking speed assessment to dementia risk screenings to help healthcare providers more accurately identify at-risk individuals. The study analyzed data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) clinical trial and found that declining gait speed and worsening performance on the memory test best predicted future dementia risk. However, the study has limitations, including that it did not distinguish between different types of dementia, and the participants were healthier than the general population.
