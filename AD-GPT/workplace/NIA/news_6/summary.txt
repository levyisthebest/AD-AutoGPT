Researchers at Boston University and Tufts Medical Center have conducted a study on the immune system profiles of centenarians, finding that their immune cell composition differs from that in younger people, suggesting that their immune systems remain healthier for longer. The study identified specific genes that were expressed differently in centenarians, including S100A4, which has been implicated in aging-related diseases and longevity. However, the small sample size of centenarians studied means that the findings should be considered preliminary.
