A study funded by the National Institute on Aging found that middle-aged women living in residential areas with more green space had faster thinking, better attention, and higher overall cognitive function. The positive impact of green space on cognitive health could be partly due to reduced rates of depression. However, living in an area with more green space did not affect learning or working memory. Further research is needed to understand how racial disparities and socioeconomic factors affect the association between green space and cognitive function.
