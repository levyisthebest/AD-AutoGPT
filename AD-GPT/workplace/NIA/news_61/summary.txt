A multidimensional MRI method developed by the National Institutes of Health can detect astrogliosis, a neuroinflammatory response that occurs in traumatic brain injury and many other neurological conditions. The method was previously established to identify diffuse axonal injury, a microscopic brain injury that cannot be detected by conventional radiological methods. The method could be applied to personalized diagnosis and therapy of TBI and other neurological conditions. The scientists are now working to adapt their multidimensional MRI method to detect astrogliosis and other neurological diseases and disorders in people.
