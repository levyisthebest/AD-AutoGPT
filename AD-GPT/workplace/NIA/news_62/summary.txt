Scientists have identified 15 genomic loci that regulate the speed of brain aging, which could help identify future drug targets for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The study was conducted by a global team of over 200 scientists who examined brain scan data from 15,640 volunteers to determine baseline measures of how fast tissue in brain regions crucial for memory, thinking, and emotions were growing or shrinking over time. The APOE gene, known to increase the risk for Alzheimer's and related dementias, was one spot that popped up in the analysis as a factor accelerating tissue decline in the hippocampus and amygdala brain regions.
