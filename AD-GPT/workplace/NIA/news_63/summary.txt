Researchers have developed a new CRISPR method to generate microglia-like cells from stem cells in just eight days, allowing them to study the effects of specific genes on microglial function. They have identified genes that affect microglial survival and activation, as well as their ability to engulf nerve cell debris, and identified nine distinct microglial states based on gene activity patterns. The findings provide potential drug targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases by shifting microglia from a pathogenic state to a healthy state. The new CRISPR method offers the opportunity for an entirely new type of therapeutic approach.
