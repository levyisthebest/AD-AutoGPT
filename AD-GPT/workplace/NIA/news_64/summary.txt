The Participant FIRST Work Group has released 17 recommendations for improving communication with clinical trial participants when trials end early, following several Alzheimer's disease clinical trials ending prematurely in 2018 and 2019. The recommendations aim to improve participants' experience and ensure they receive timely and accurate information about the trial's end, including providing resources for orderly trial close-out, regularly updating contact information, and contacting participants as soon as possible in the event of early stopping. More information can be found on the Alzheimers.gov Clinical Trials Finder.
