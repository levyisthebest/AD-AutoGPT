A study supported by the National Institute on Aging found that nearly 40% of older adults may experience brain damage caused by Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE), a form of dementia often mistaken for Alzheimer's disease. The study provides further support for the recognition of LATE as a separate-from-Alzheimer's, commonly occurring dementia. The results suggest that recognizing LATE as a common and distinct disorder may ultimately help researchers better understand and develop precise treatments for those who experience dementia.
