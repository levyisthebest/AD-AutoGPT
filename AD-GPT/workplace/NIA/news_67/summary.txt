The NIH Center for Alzheimer's and Related Dementias has launched a web portal that allows researchers to order stem cells engineered for studying the genes behind neurodegenerative disorders. The iPSC Neurodegenerative Disease Initiative is a collaborative project aimed at facilitating neurodegenerative research funded by NIH CARD, the Jackson Laboratory, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The project uses induced pluripotent stem cells to study how gene variants may cause nervous system tissue to degenerate and translate their findings into new treatments. Scientists can order samples of the cells via www.jax.org/ipsc.
