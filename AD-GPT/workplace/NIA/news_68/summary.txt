Exposure to social stress can accelerate aging of the immune system, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. The study found that social stress was associated with a greater proportion of T cells committed only to fighting infections already encountered and fewer T cells that could adapt to new challenges, indicative of accelerated immune aging. However, controlling for lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise habits weakened the connection between stress and immune aging. Increased immune aging is linked to chronic diseases, weakened response to infections, and reduced efficacy of vaccines. The study highlights potential intervention points to address inequalities in aging.
