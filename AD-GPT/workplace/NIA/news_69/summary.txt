The National Institute on Aging has released a statement on the role of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) in Alzheimer's and related dementias. Aβ can cause neuronal cell damage and inflammation when it accumulates abnormally in Alzheimer's. Research on Aβ*56, an oligomer associated with Alzheimer's disease, has been limited due to the lack of specific markers to detect it in laboratories. The NIH National Institute on Aging supports a wide range of studies investigating the causes of Alzheimer's, including genetics, environmental factors, inflammation, and the vascular system.
