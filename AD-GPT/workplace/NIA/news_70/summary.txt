Researchers at the National Institute on Aging have found that a DNA variant in immune cells called microglia increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. The variant is located near the LRKK2 gene, which has been linked to late-stage Parkinson's disease in families. The study suggests that inhibiting LRKK2 may benefit those without a family history of the disease and that dysfunctional LRKK2 protein in microglia may contribute to inflammation and neuronal death in Parkinson's. The research was conducted by NIA Intramural Research Program scientists.
