NIH Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias Professional Judgment Budget for FY2024 now online
July 25, 2022
Alzheimer's DiseaseDementias
During the July 25th meeting of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer’s Research, Care, and Services, NIA Director Richard J. Hodes, M.D., unveiled NIH’s Fiscal Year 2024 (FY2024) Professional Judgment Budget for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias. Looking Forward: Opportunities to Accelerate Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias Research (PDF, 11M) provides an estimate of the funds needed to enable NIH to fully pursue scientific opportunities to inform effective prevention, treatment, and care of those living with these diseases.
This year, the budget proposal narrative outlines examples of prospective research opportunities that NIH could support with additional funds in FY2024. These research opportunities are organized in the following broad categories: Epidemiology/Population Studies; Disease Mechanisms; Diagnosis, Assessment, & Disease Monitoring; Translational Research & Clinical Interventions; Dementia Care & Impact of Disease; and Research Resources. The budget proposal also emphasizes significant cross-cutting research efforts centered on health equity, inclusion, and workforce diversity, and describes new initiatives that reaffirm NIH’s commitment in these areas.
Previous NIH Alzheimer’s and related dementias budget proposals have been accompanied by a scientific progress report detailing important recent advances in the dementia research field. NIH will release this year’s progress report separately this fall.
