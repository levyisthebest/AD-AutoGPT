Injecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from young mice into the brains of older mice can improve their memory recall, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. The study suggests that a protein in the young CSF triggers the growth and maturation of cells that help protect brain function in older mice, highlighting the therapeutic potential of CSF proteins found in young mice fluid and the role that these "helper cells" play in brain aging. The findings could lead to new treatments for age-related brain disorders.
