A new study involving over 100 researchers has found that reptiles and amphibians do not age slower or live longer than warm-blooded species on average, but protective traits such as hard shells or poison contribute to slower aging in some species. Another study found that reptiles and amphibians that begin reproducing at later ages tend to age more slowly and live longer, while species that produce more eggs age faster. The findings could inform conservation strategies for threatened or endangered species. About 80% of turtle and tortoise species studied aged more slowly than humans, supporting the idea that species with protection tend to age slowly and live for a long time.
