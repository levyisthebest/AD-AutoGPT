A new observational study funded by the National Institute on Aging suggests that taking statins, a cholesterol-lowering drug, may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's-like movement symptoms in older adults. The study found that taking statins was associated with improved brain blood vessel health and decreased parkinsonian signs in older adults. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine if statins can prevent or treat parkinsonism.
