Strength training can help maintain muscle mass, improve mobility, and increase healthy years of life as we age. Age-related mobility limitations are common due to the loss of muscle mass and strength, known as sarcopenia. Maintaining an active lifestyle and engaging in strength training can slow down this decline and help maintain mobility and independence. A combination of walking and resistance training is the best recipe for improving physical function and avoiding disability in older adults. Even a low-intensity strength and walking program has substantial benefits.
