A study supported by the National Institute on Aging found that overactive neurons responsible for wakefulness disrupt sleep in aging mice. Drugs that reduce neuron activity help improve sleep, suggesting a potential strategy to improve sleep quality in older adults. The study sheds light on the mechanism behind sleep disruptions in aging and could lead to new treatments for poor sleep in older adults.
