New research has identified specific blood lipids associated with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 gene that could potentially be new targets for Alzheimer’s prevention. The study found that more than 200 lipids were associated with APOE ε2 and more than 100 were associated with APOE ε4. Specific lipids, including alkyl diacylglycerols, have been identified as mediators of the protective effects of APOE ε2 against Alzheimer's disease. This discovery may lead to new avenues for preventing Alzheimer's through dietary supplementation.
