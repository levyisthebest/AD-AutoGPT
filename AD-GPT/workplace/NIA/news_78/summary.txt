The National Institute on Aging has announced that a clinical trial for the anti-amyloid drug crenezumab did not show a significant clinical benefit in people with the inherited form of Alzheimer's disease. The trial was supported by various organizations, and the full data will guide further research. The drug was tested in 252 young cognitively unimpaired participants in Colombia who carry a rare gene mutation making them virtually certain to develop Alzheimer's. The results will be presented at the 2022 Alzheimerâ€™s Association International Conference and may impact how amyloid is studied as a prevention and therapeutic target for Alzheimer's.
