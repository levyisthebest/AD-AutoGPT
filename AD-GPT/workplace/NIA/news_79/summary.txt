Abnormal white matter structures in the brain, known as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), may be a biomarker for future frailty risk, according to a study funded by the National Institute on Aging. Frail individuals had more WMH than non-frail participants, and those with a high volume of WMH had an increased risk of developing frailty during a seven-year follow-up period. This suggests that physical frailty may be a clinical indicator of cerebral small vessel disease and an increased risk for future dementia or cognitive deterioration. Further studies are needed to determine the causal role of neurological factors in frailty development.
