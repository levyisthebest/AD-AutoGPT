Frequent COVID-19 testing of staff in nursing facilities reduced deaths, according to NIH-funded research. The study found that facilities that did the most testing detected about 15% more infections among staff, suggesting that frequent testing captured more asymptomatic staff infections that could seed outbreaks. During the Omicron wave, frequent testing continued to reduce the number of cases among residents, but no longer impacted the number of deaths, reflecting the effectiveness of vaccines against the virus.
