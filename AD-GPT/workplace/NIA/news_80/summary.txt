New research published in Science has identified two distinct forms of amyloid fibers in plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, with different molecular structures. The study used cryo-electron microscopy to examine the structure of AÎ²42 filaments extracted from post-autopsy brain tissue samples of individuals with different types of Alzheimer's and other degenerative brain conditions. The findings may lead to a better understanding of the molecular features of amyloid plaques in the brain and the development of more targeted treatments for different types of Alzheimer's disease.
