Senescent brain cells with high levels of tau protein have been found to contribute to Alzheimer's disease, according to a study published in Nature Aging. The study suggests that drugs targeting these cells could be effective treatments for Alzheimer's. The research was supported by multiple NIA grants and could help identify and analyze senescent cells in other tissues and organs.
