A study by the National Institute on Aging found that higher blood levels of carotenoids, specifically lutein, zeaxanthin, and Î²-cryptoxanthin, are associated with a reduced risk of developing dementia. However, the benefit disappeared when lifestyle and socioeconomic factors were taken into account. Blood levels of antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E were not individually associated with dementia risk, and high levels of vitamin A and E might counteract the effects of other antioxidants. Further studies are needed to determine whether adding certain antioxidants can help protect the brain from dementia.
