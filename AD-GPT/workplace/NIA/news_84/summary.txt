A decline in sense of smell, or anosmia, is linked to faster buildup of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology seen in brain scans, according to a study of 364 participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. The research found that loss of smell is a key early sign of Alzheimer's-related cognitive impairment and the accumulation of associated harmful proteins, such as amyloid-beta and tau. Each point of lower odor identification test performance was associated with a 22% higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
