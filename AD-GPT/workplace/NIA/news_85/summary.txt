A study of 1.7 million New Zealand citizens found that individuals with a prior mental disorder diagnosis were more than four times as likely to develop dementia than those without a mental disorder. The increased dementia risk was stronger for those with prior mental versus physical disorders, and individuals with a prior mental disorder diagnosis developed dementia more than five years earlier than those without. The findings suggest that treating mental disorders earlier in life may reduce the risk of developing dementia.
