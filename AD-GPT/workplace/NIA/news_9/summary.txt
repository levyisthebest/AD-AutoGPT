Aging is linked to an increase in shorter RNA molecules, which are associated with aging processes such as inflammation. This creates an imbalance with longer transcripts, which are linked to increased lifespan. The imbalance is strongest in brain cells and may be due to environmental or age-related cellular events. Seven anti-aging interventions were found to increase the number of long transcripts, restoring some balance to the transcriptome. The research was supported by NIA grants.
