A 74-year-old British grandmother with Alzheimer's who has lived in Sweden for nearly two decades is facing deportation after her application to remain in the country post-Brexit was not accepted. Her family says her application was rejected because she did not have a valid British passport, which she did not need due to her poor health. The case highlights the vulnerability of elderly citizens who have to reapply for their status post-Brexit. Sweden has expelled 1,100 British nationals since Brexit. The UK Foreign Office said it is supporting the woman and her family in Sweden.
