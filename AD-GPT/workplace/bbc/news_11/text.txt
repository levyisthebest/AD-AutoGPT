"And then it started getting a bit more drastic, especially when I was actually at work." She said that with some of the broadcasting work, she could record it again "but of course, the live stuff finds you out".In a message for the fundraiser, Rae's son Rory Cargill said that, after 30 years on air, his mum had been left unable to work because of the condition.Alzheimer's disease affects the brain, and it is the most common cause of dementia. One of the most common symptoms is memory loss, and it can affect people of different ages - but over-65s are more susceptible to the disease.Rae, who is 66, said she still felt physically very strong, which is often a good thing. But in other ways, she adds, "you wish your brain was a great deal stronger than your physical body".

But she told the programme that her biggest challenge was dealing with loneliness in her new home."I've lost a lot of my friends," she said. "I haven't physically lost them but I've missed being at the BBC with all my friends. That's the biggest thing."Among those who have given donations to the fundraiser are several Radio 4 and Radio 3 listeners who remember her decades on air, working as a journalist, newsreader, continuity announcer and even reading the shipping forecast. One paid tribute to her "melodious Scottish voice". Asked about the public support towards her fundraiser, Rae said: "I just want to say that this has been the most extraordinary moment about all of this. I'm overwhelmed actually." "All these people have been in touch with lovely messages. People are generally great. And thank you so much. I'm so chuffed. Thank you."Image caption, Susan Rae (middle) presented Radio 4's You and Yours, in this picture taken in 1990 Susan is alongside fellow presenters at the time, John Buckley (left) and John Howard (right).Paddy O'Connell's interview with Susan Rae is available on BBC Sounds, and you can listen to it here.MISSING GOLD: The inside story of Britain's biggest gold heistDECADES OF DISHONESTY: Everyone has their own version of right and wrong...Related TopicsAlzheimer'sTop StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished26 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan hails election victory but Turkey dividedPublished1 hour agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan hails election victory but Turkey divided9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
