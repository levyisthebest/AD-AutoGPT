The University of Essex is conducting a study to identify early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by exploring how retaining information in the "working memory" is affected by the condition. The study involves Zoom calls with about 150 people and aims to distinguish between normal forgetfulness and dementia, allowing for early treatment. The study is in its early stages and results are expected in the summer.
