Actor Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a group of brain disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language. There is no cure for the disease, and diagnosis is made by eliminating other conditions. Patients eventually require full-time care, and on average, people live eight to 10 years after diagnosis. Willis' family recently announced that he has dementia.
