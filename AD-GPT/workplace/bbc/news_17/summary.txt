John Lydon, former frontman of the Sex Pistols and founder of Public Image Ltd, is one of six acts competing to represent Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in May 2023. His song is a love letter to his wife who has Alzheimer's, aimed at raising awareness of the disease. The winner will be chosen by a national jury, an international jury, and a public vote on Ireland's The Late Late Show on Friday. Other finalists include Irish band Wild Youth and singer Conor O'Donohoe.
