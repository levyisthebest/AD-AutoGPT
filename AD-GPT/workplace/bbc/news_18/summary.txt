Alzheimer's Research UK has launched a brain check-up tool that offers tips on reducing the risk of dementia. The tool is based on research that suggests there are 12 risk factors for dementia that, if modified, could prevent four in 10 people from developing memory loss, confusion and communication problems. The advice includes stopping smoking, regular exercise, cutting back on alcohol and challenging the brain. Alzheimer's Research UK has stated that 40% of dementia cases could be preventable.
