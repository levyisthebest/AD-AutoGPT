Many of those things cannot be changed, which is why there is no foolproof way of preventing dementia in 60% of cases."It's important not to blame people for getting dementia," said Dr Charles Marshall, clinical senior lecturer in dementia at Queen Mary University of London.Some groups, such as those from poorer background and those with less education, are at higher risk.But he said the NHS Health Check, a service for those aged 40-74, could be used to test brain health and give people advice on how to improve it, while also identifying those with early signs of dementia.At present it takes an average of three years to get a diagnosis of dementia and there are very few treatments for symptoms."We need the same diagnostic process for dementia as for cancer, and that means redesigning services," Dr Marshall said."We need to prepare now for delivering new treatments when they come."A drug called lecanemab has recently shown promise at slowing the decline of the brain in people with Alzheimer's. Hilary Evans, chief executive of Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "With 40% of dementia cases potentially being preventable, there's an enormous opportunity to reduce the personal and societal impact of this heart-breaking condition."It's time for the nation to wake up to the idea of brain health and how looking after our brains can reduce the risk of dementia."
