All women who took part in the European initiative were over 50 and had no dementia diagnosis when joining it.This study then looked at results of cognitive tests and brain volumes as recorded by MRI scans.Dr Rasha Saleh, from UEA's Norwich Medical School. said the findings suggested HRT use was associated with "better memory and larger brain volumes" among the APOE4 gene carriers.If confirmed in a clinical trial, she said, the effects of HRT would "equate to a brain age that is several years younger".Prof Minihane said the results of the study were a "very nice finding" that would encourage them to run further studies.The next stage will be to go on to a clinical trial, she said."We'll recruit people who are E4 and non-E4," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme."Put women on HRT, follow them up, study them in quite a lot of detail, and hopefully that will provide us with a definitive answer as to whether HRT is a really effective therapy in women who carry this E4 gene."
She added: "The other major news I suppose was that the earlier the better - that HRT use seemed to be particularly beneficial in women who started it during the perimenopausal or early post-menopausal period." 'Larger scale studies needed'Dr Sara Imarisio, head of strategic initiatives at the Alzheimer's Research UK, said the study provided evidence that HRT could have some cognitive benefits, but the findings needed to be confirmed with trials that directly tested it."The next step is to investigate this in more detail. Importantly, this study didn't measure whether women went on to develop dementia."So, its findings need to be confirmed, first in trials that directly test whether giving HRT affects women's cognitive abilities and changes in their brain, particularly carriers of the APOE4 gene."This will then help pave the way for finding possible interventions, for example clinical trials to see if it could eventually prevent dementia, and to help understand why dementia disproportionately affects women in the UK."Alzheimer's Society's associate director of research Dr Richard Oakley also said more studies were needed.He said: "Studies of this kind are important as they hint at a link between HRT and the changes to the brain."We need more studies, on a larger scale, to better understand this link."Alzheimer's is more common in women than in men - almost two thirds of Alzheimer's patients in the UK are women.Although the APOE4 gene is known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease, people with the gene will not necessarily develop the condition.Related TopicsDementiaHormone replacement therapy (HRT)University of East AngliaAlzheimer'sMenopauseNorwichMore on this story'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying'Published27 April 2022Lower cost HRT prescriptions in England from AprilPublished1 AprilHRT: 'Don't be alarmed by Alzheimer's risk'Published7 March 2019Related Internet LinksAlzheimer's SocietyThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished30 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan supporters celebrate win in divided TurkeyPublished4 minutes agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan hails election victory but Turkey divided9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
