Supporters of Turkish President Erdogan celebrate his election victory, while a village in Darfur is burned down by militias. Other news includes Ricky Gervais' new BBC project and a campaign to provide sanitary pads for women in need. The BBC also features stories on anti-snoring products, road trip music, and a prison escape from Alcatraz. The Alzheimer's Society calls for more early diagnosis of the disease.
