It's not a normal thing to do, to hit someone, so it was quite an unnatural thing to learn."Image source, Ella GriffithImage caption, Ms Griffith has raised more than £500 for Alzheimer's SocietyMs Griffith said it felt poignant to raise money to combat Alzheimer's because of the impact the disease is having on her family."It's been really hard to see my Mum have both parents affected simultaneously... and for my grandparents' other halves, who have become primary carers," she said."It turns their life upside down and it's really painful to see that." She added that people's response to the challenge was heart-warming."People have really rallied behind me and it's reassuring that people are happy to support the cause."Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
