Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron has called for an "insurance intervention" to address the "catastrophic costs" of social care, which Tory governments have failed to cut. The delay of the cap on social care costs has been criticized by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot, who accused Health Secretary Stephen Barclay of breaking the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto commitment to fix social care. Meanwhile, the BBC features a variety of content, including a new project by Ricky Gervais, analysis of Turkish President Erdogan's recent actions, and discussions on various topics.
