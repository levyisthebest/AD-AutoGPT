The former prime minister told BBC News his government "looked at, but couldn't crack" the issue of people having to sell their homes in old age. A cap on the amount people in England pay for their social care was due to be introduced in October 2023. But this was postponed for two years in the chancellor's autumn statement. Jeremy Hunt blamed concerns over staffing and financial pressures on health and social-care services.'Better-off households'The plans included a more generous means test and a lifetime cap on personal care costs of £86,000.The cap was first proposed by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in 2011.
Mr Cameron, president of Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC's Newscast podcast: "The problem governments keep coming across is that while the Dilnot cap...
is a very good idea, it does tend to benefit relatively better-off households.What is happening to the cap on care costs?Social care cap delay attacked as sickeningDelay cap on social care costs, councils warn Alzheimer's drug hailed as momentous breakthrough"If I had any advice for my successors now - and I try to keep my interventions to a minimum because their jobs are hard enough without ex-prime ministers giving a running commentary - I think looking again, if there isn't some sort of insurance intervention where we can help people protect against the catastrophic costs of selling their home to pay for care, I think that might be a good place to look."Delaying the introduction of the cap means some people will continue to pay more than £86,000 for their lifetime care needs.The government said an extra £2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and £4.7bn the following year.This Twitter post cannot be displayed in your browser.

Councils had warned adult care services could deteriorate unless the rollout was postponed. But Sir Andrew said the delay was "extraordinarily disappointing", accusing Mr Hunt of breaking the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto commitment to fix social care.Mr Cameron spoke to Newscast on the day health experts and charities welcomed a new drug treatment for Alzheimer's as a ground-breaking moment in the fight against the disease. Lecanemab is the first drug to slow the brain's destruction - after decades of failed trials.'Eaten away'Mr Cameron said: "I've been president of Alzheimer's Research UK for five years now and this, I think, is the happiest day that we've had. "One can't overdo the enthusiasm but it feels like a breakthrough and it's very good news. "It will also just push forward a lot more research and a lot more enthusiasm."This will really generate some enthusiasm from pharmaceutical companies, from scientists, from all those that we need to work so hard."Mr Cameron, whose mother, Mary, has Alzheimer's, said: "It's a very tough thing for families. You see someone with their memory just slowly being eaten away at by one of these diseases of the brain."We're a country of 60 million people. Soon, we're going to have a million people with dementia. It's going to be the most costly health condition. "It's going to be the biggest cause of of death. But far from the statistics, it's just going to be a tragedy for so many families. And I've seen that with my own family."You can hear the full interview with David Cameron on Newscast, on BBC Sounds.Related TopicsDavid CameronSocial careAlzheimer'sMore on this storyWhat is happening to the cap on care costs?Published20 November 2022Health secretary defends delay to social care capPublished20 November 2022Social care cap delay attacked as sickeningPublished18 November 2022Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished33 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan supporters celebrate win in divided TurkeyPublished8 minutes agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan supporters celebrate win in divided Turkey9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
