Lecanemab, a new drug developed by Eisai and Biogen, has shown promise in slowing down the progression of Alzheimer's disease in early stages by targeting beta amyloid. While the drug has only been available through clinical trials, it is currently being reviewed by regulators in the US and the UK. Its long-term impact is still unknown, but it has been found to slow the decline of the disease by around a quarter in the first 18 months of treatment. The drug only works for Alzheimer's disease and not other forms of dementia.
