"It's all about sleep management, stress management, nutrition, movement, fitness. It's all kind of the same tools that need to be applied in a consistent way."The Limitless series sees Hemsworth test his body and explore ways to live longer and healthier.He explained that he had not been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, but had been warned of the heightened risk. "It's not a pre-deterministic gene, but it is a strong indication," he said. "Ten years ago, I think it was more thought of as determinant."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Chris Hemsworth appeared in Netflix movie Spiderhead earlier this year and will appear in the forthcoming Mad Max film FuriosaHemsworth said the original plan for the series would have seen him receive all his genetic test results live to camera - but series creator Darren Aronofsky told him privately once they got the results.The Marvel star was subsequently given the option of removing any references to Alzheimer's from the show, but decided to include his genetic risk of Alzheimer's to improve awareness and understanding."My concern was I just didn't want to manipulate it and over-dramatise it, and make it into some sort of hokey grab at empathy or whatever for entertainment," he said.Hemsworth also confirmed to the magazine his grandfather has also been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.The actor will soon be seen in George Miller's forthcoming Mad Max sequel Furiosa, which concluded filming earlier this month. The 39-year-old said he would take a break from acting after finishing the publicity tour for Limitless, along with his other contracted work.He will be going home to Byron Bay in Australia to spend time with his partner, actor Elsa Pataky, and their three children.Related TopicsHealthFilmAlzheimer'sMore on this storyAlzheimer's research takes 'leap forward'Published4 April 2022Alzheimer's-slowing drug labelled historicPublished28 September 2022Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished36 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan supporters celebrate win in divided TurkeyPublished11 minutes agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan supporters celebrate win in divided Turkey9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
