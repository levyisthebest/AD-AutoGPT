An inquest has revealed that care home staff copied the wrong person's details into a woman's care plan before she died. The woman, Janice Hopper, died from natural causes but the coroner will issue a Prevention of Future Deaths Report due to failures and delays in addressing issues at the care home. The BBC website features a range of articles and audio content on various topics including Turkish politics, menstrual hygiene, and interviews with journalist Clive Myrie and comedian Robert Webb.
