Male carers of people with dementia are being urged to seek help and support, as they often find it difficult to open up about their worries and the stresses they face. Dementia UK has said that the condition is a "huge and growing health crisis" with over 900,000 people in the UK currently diagnosed. The need to open up conversations around barriers that prevent some men seeking support is becoming ever greater.
