US scientists have discovered that "super-agers" - elderly people who retain exceptional cognitive ability comparable to people 30 years younger - have larger nerve cells in regions of the brain responsible for memory. The research may help explore new ways to fight dementia. Researchers at Northwestern University in the US have launched a SuperAging Program to study the brains of people over 80 with exceptional memories. The study could help towards finding and developing new treatments for dementia.
