These elite "super-agers" have larger nerve cells in regions of the brain responsible for memory, new research in The Journal of Neuroscience shows.The octogenarians may have been born that way, or their neurons grew more or shrank less with age than in others.More study is needed, which may help explore new ways to fight dementia.In particular, researchers want to ascertain how changes in nerve cells might impact long-term brain health. Do they offer some protection in old age or are they simply a reflection of better brain health?Postmortem examinationsThe key aim of the SuperAging Research Program at Northwestern University in Illinois - which has been running for more than a decade - is to find out what keeps the brain cognitively sharp and protects people from dementia.
Those taking part must be over 80, have an outstanding memory, be willing to undergo various checks and tests - and agree to donate their brain to medical science after their death.Image source, Getty ImagesBased on past work using MRI scans, researchers have already concluded that the brains of so-called super-agers look and work more like those of a 50-year-old, rather than an 80-year-old.The latest research - based on postmortem examinations - focuses on a region of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex, which is involved with memory.The researchers studied the brains of six super-agers, seven "cognitively average" octogenarians, five people with early-stage Alzheimer's and six younger donors who died from non brain-related disease. They found the super-agers had bigger, healthier neurons in this brain region than the others.They also appear to be less prone to accumulating abnormal deposits of protein, known as tangles, typically seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's. Dr Rosa Sancho, from Alzheimer's Research UK, believes projects such as the SuperAging Program might help towards finding and developing new treatments for dementia."Further research will need to uncover exactly what causes these super-ager brain cells to be larger and better protected," said Dr Sancho. "For example, is it a genetic feature super-agers are born with, and if so what features?"Living with dementiaSimple steps to better brain healthShe added: "While researchers work to understand how to stop changes in the brain that cause dementia, there are small steps we can all take to keep our brains healthy as we age."The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, but a number of things are thought to increase the risk.While some, such as age and genetics, are unavoidable, lifestyle factors such as abstaining from smoking, eating a healthier diet and exercising, can lower the risk.Lead researcher at Northwestern, Prof Tamar Gefen, told the BBC that they planned to build a detailed picture of the super-agers to understand more: "We need to study their genetics, lifestyle factors and educational attainment. We also need to capture their history and personal narratives. I have been fortunate to know these inspiring people intimately in both life and in death."Related TopicsDementiaBrainAlzheimer'sMore on this storyAlzheimer's-slowing drug labelled historicPublished28 September 2022Related Internet LinksAlzheimer's Research UKJournal of NeuroscienceThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished41 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan supporters celebrate win in divided TurkeyPublished15 minutes agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave7Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims8Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage9Erdogan supporters celebrate win in divided Turkey10'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'BBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
