A 93-year-old man with an arthritic hip has walked almost a half-marathon in memory of his late wife and has raised over Â£4,500 for the Alzheimer's Society. Meanwhile, ITV's This Morning denies claims of "toxicity", Erdogan supporters celebrate a win in Turkey, and Ricky Gervais is set to release his first BBC project in 10 years. The BBC features stories on anti-snoring products, road trip music, and the strange prison escape from Alcatraz. The most read stories include an athlete dying during a triathlon, a flesh-eating bug nearly killing a new mother, and a tourist boat sinking in Italy.
