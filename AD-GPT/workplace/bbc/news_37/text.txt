Can you imagine that for someone with Alzheimer's? "We did so many things together for many, many years. We went all over the world."Image source, Neil NormanImage caption, The route around the block for the walkNow he sees walking and fundraising for the charity that helped them as a challenge and a way to keep himself going. "Grieving is a form of self pity and with my hip going, I realised I was sitting around too much " he said.But even though the goal was 100 laps, he revealed he might just keep on going.He said: "I've got to keep moving. It's the old saying, if you don't use it, you lose it. Image source, Neil NormanImage caption, "Anne was the love of my life, she was my life", says Neil"I can't get a new hip, so I've just got to keep using it."He hopes that he can keep raising money and has mixed emotions about his 100th lap, after reading comments on his fundraising page."It's just amazing. If I listen to them, I wouldn't get my head through the door.Image source, Peter NormanImage caption, A well-earned rest and praise for the 93-year-old after his effortsWALES' HOME OF THE YEAR: Which home will Owain, Mandy and Glen judge worthy?SEARCHING FOR MY OTHER MAM: Gerallt searches for the father and mother he never knewRelated TopicsSwanseaDementiaAlzheimer'sMore on this storyAre daffodils the future for Wales' hill farms?Published19 April 2022Man, 80, walks on wings in memory of late wifePublished19 August 2021Alzheimer's research takes 'leap forward'Published4 April 2022Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished43 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan supporters celebrate win in divided TurkeyPublished17 minutes agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave7Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims8Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage9Erdogan supporters celebrate win in divided Turkey10'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'BBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
