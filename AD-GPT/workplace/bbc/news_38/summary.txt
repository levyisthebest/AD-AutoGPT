Harmless brain stimulation with electricity can boost memory for at least a month, according to a study published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. The technique could have potential treatment options for memory decline, disease and exam preparation. Another study found that electrical stimulation of the brain can improve memory in older people, with researchers investigating whether the technique could be used to stimulate surviving brain cells in Alzheimerâ€™s patients.
