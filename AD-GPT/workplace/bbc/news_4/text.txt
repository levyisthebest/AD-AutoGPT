"The specialist asked if there was anything dad wanted to ask, thinking it would be about what's to come. And dad said, bearing in mind he hasn't played football for a long time, 'Am I still able to do my warm ups for football?'"His memory then further deteriorated over the first Covid lockdown. Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Whymark was well-known for his heading ability during his playing careerMr Whymark said: "We [his children] noticed when we did see him that his memory was sort of decreasing and getting worse... the realisation kicked in a little bit more and we were still coming to terms with the fact dad had Alzheimer's."Fellow former Ipswich Town player Terry Butcher, who has documented links between Alzheimer's and football, said Whymark was "one of the best headers of a ball I've seen".Mr Whymark said his dad's heading skills were honed as a child with a leather football when he would do up to 1,000 headers against a neighbour's wall. "With Alzheimer's [and the] constant banging of the head with the ball, that has got to have something to do with it,"
his son said.He said it was "hard" to announce his father's diagnosis but after launching the fundraising page they have been inundated with support.

"It is only right that they can get the support needed when suffering with this disease."Listen to the full interview on Life's a Pitch on Saturday.Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
