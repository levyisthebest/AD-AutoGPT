Junior doctor Meg Pragnell plans to raise Â£6,000 for Alzheimer's Society and a hospice by completing a British triathlon challenge, which involves climbing the Three Peaks, swimming some of its largest lakes, and cycling between the three. The challenge will start on 18 September, and Dr Pragnell has been fundraising online. The BBC also offers various news stories, services, and personalized newsletters, including articles on anti-snoring products, road trip music, and a prison escape. The most read stories include an athlete dying during a triathlon, a flesh-eating bug nearly killing a new mother, and a tourist boat sinking in Italy.
