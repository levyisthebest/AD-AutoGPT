An 82-year-old man from Scotland is close to completing his challenge of climbing all 282 Munros to raise money for Alzheimer Scotland and the Royal Osteoporosis Society. He had never climbed a Munro before but set himself the challenge to keep himself going after his wife went into full-time care due to Alzheimer's and osteoporosis. He has raised more than his initial target of £10,000 and is on track to reach £50,000. The BBC offers an audio program on how to be a man in the 2020s, along with other content on their website.
