I have butterflies."Once he makes it to the finish line, Mr Gardner will have climbed more than 500,000ft (152,000m), the equivalent of scaling Mount Everest (8,848m) about 17 times.He will also have walked 2,000 miles (3,218 km), a similar distance to hiking from Edinburgh to Greece.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Mr Gardner has taken in some spectacular viewsOne of his two daughters, Sally McKenzie, has nominated him to the Guinness Book of World Records for the oldest person to climb the Munros.Mr Gardener joked: "I'll probably cry when I make it to the end".With a compass in one hand and a map in the other, Mr Gardner said he loved the feeling of being on the hillside.But he added that he was never truly on his own.He said: "I am over 80, and I think it would be irresponsible to climb on my own at this age, so I always have people with me."I don't climb in a rush, and after the first two or three Munros I just started stopping people on the hill to tell them what I was doing."People couldn't believe it, and they started joining me and donating money."Now, when I am walking, I regularly hear, 'Nick' shouted."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The Black Cuillin is a range of high mountains, ridges and rocky pinnaclesMr Gardner has developed immense respect for mountains."I have never conquered or beaten a mountain, I have climbed them," he said. "If you start trying to conquer them, they will get their own back."Out of the 274 peaks he has scaled so far, Mr Gardner said completing the Cuillin Ridge on the Isle of Skye about a month ago stuck out as his most physically challenging moment.He said: "It's hard for people to do in their 40s, let alone 80s. It was incredibly rewarding," he said."I am not a religious person, but there is something almost biblical about it, certainly spiritual."Mr Gardner's checklist for reaching Scotland's highest peaks includes a head torch, waterproof clothing, a down jacket and a spare warm garment. But he said a map and compass were his essentials.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, Mr Gardner has endured all sorts of conditions during his questThe remaining peaks for the intrepid grandfather are three in Knoydart: Ladhar, Mell Buidhe and Luinne Bheinn; four in Glen Dessary: Sgurr na ciche, Garbh chioche mhor, Sgurr nan coireachan and Sgurr Mor; and lastly, the 282nd summit at Cairn Gorm in the Highlands where he will be joined by friends and family for the final climb.Mr Gardner's target was initially to raise £10,000, but he is now on track to reaching £50,000.He added: "I will keep walking when I've finished this challenge, as long as my legs can carry me."Craig Jones, chief executive of the ROS, will be joining Mr Gardner on the final climb and said the charity was "extremely grateful" for the fundraiser.Kirsty Stewart, of Alzheimer Scotland, added: "His tremendous effort will help us continue to be there for people living with dementia, their families and their carers."Related TopicsGairlochAlzheimer'sRelated Internet LinksAlzheimer ScotlandRoyal Osteoporosis SocietyThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.From other local news sites'Once-in-a-lifetime' encounter with killer whales on eve of Orca WatchExternalJohn O' Groat JournalInverness church's community garden plan gets green lightExternalInverness CourierBen Nevis 24-hour record broken by Inverness hill runnerExternalNorthern TimesMan and woman to appear in court in connection to alleged offences in Wester RossExternalRoss-shire JournalNairn firm's ‘memory’ candle to aid Highlanders living with dementiaExternalInverness CourierNorth MP calls for A9 dualling project to be extended to Invergordon for freeport jobs boomExternalPress and JournalInformation about BBC links to other news sitesTop StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished45 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan supporters celebrate win in divided TurkeyPublished20 minutes agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave7Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims8Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage9Erdogan supporters celebrate win in divided Turkey10'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'BBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
