The family of an 85-year-old woman with Alzheimer's who died after breaking her hip in a hospital fall has criticized the care she received in a Leeds hospital. The BBC reports on a range of news stories, including concerns over cuts to mental health response by the Met Police, Phillip Schofield's denial of "toxicity" claims on This Morning, and the celebration of Erdogan's win in Turkey.
