Deaths caused by Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia have fallen by 5% in Scotland, with 6,046 deaths in 2021, 306 fewer than the year before. However, the current death rate is still more than twice as high as it was in 2000. More than 90,000 people in Scotland have dementia, and deaths by Alzheimer's and other dementias were 1.3 times more likely to occur in deprived areas compared to the least deprived areas. Age Scotland has called for increased care and support for people living with dementia, emphasizing the need for early diagnosis, preventative social care, and community-based support.
