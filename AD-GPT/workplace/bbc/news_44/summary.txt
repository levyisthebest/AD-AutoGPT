The Bristol Dementia Wellbeing Service has launched a podcast presented by people with dementia to encourage open discussion about the condition. The pilot episode was launched during Dementia Awareness Week and the group hopes to make more in the future. Other news in the Weston Mercury includes the reopening of a derelict railway station, the reopening of the M5 after a collision, and the biggest jail terms imposed in Bristol in the last nine months. There are also articles on anti-snoring products, road trip music, and the strange prison escape from Alcatraz in 1962 on the BBC.
