So instead of teaching them all the bad things there are, why not teach them about humanity? And part of humanity is getting ill and dying."Image source, John and Briony HydeImage caption, Mr Hyde said: "I've travelled the world, I've got kids, lots of grandchildren. Who could ask for more really?"Mr Hyde, who also writes children's books, said dementia "steals your humanity" but added that making the podcast had kept his brain cells "oiled.""It is really key for all of us ageing, but particularly for people with dementia, to continue learning, to continue being in a situation where there is new stimulus because that helps to keep our brain as active as it can be," added Ms Caverly.She said one of the aims of the BDWS, a partnership between Alzheimer's Society and Devon Partnership Trust, was to create opportunities for people affected by dementia to "continue enjoying their everyday existence".The pilot episode was launched on Bristol Dementia Wellbeing Service's website as part of Dementia Awareness Week (16-22 May) and the group hopes to make more in the future.Mr Hyde is now "looking forward" to working more with the service, visiting schools to talk to children about the disease."[Dementia has] given me a different life. But whatever we've got, whatever we haven't got, make a life of it."Even if I pass away tomorrow I could look him in the eye up in heaven and say thank you for my lovely life, I've had a real good life down there," he added.Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
