A PhD student at the University of Bristol has developed "smart socks" that track heart rate, sweat levels, and motion to help carers intervene before people with dementia and autism become distressed. The Alzheimer's Society is helping fund the development of the socks, and the technology is currently being tested before it goes on sale next year. The Weston Mercury reports on the reopening of a derelict Bristol railway station after 60 years, the reopening of the M5 in North Somerset following a collision, and the biggest jail terms imposed in Bristol in the last nine months.
