"We got a singer and just for them few hours she was a different mum."Sharon's daughter, Claire Middleton, said: "We've looked after my nana and seen it, first hand, what the horrible disease does and how it takes your life away, so us doing this is quite rewarding."Image source, Family photographImage caption, Rod Sellers is a regular at the groupRod Sellers is a regular at the group and looks forward to seeing his friends there.
