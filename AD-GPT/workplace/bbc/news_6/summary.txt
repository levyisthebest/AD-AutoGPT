Players in the England vs Australia women's football friendly wore nameless shirts to raise awareness for dementia, with a third of the players wearing them to highlight the ratio of people born in the UK who will develop the disease. The match was designated an 'Alzheimer's Society International' and a mural was unveiled at Brentford's Gtech Community Stadium of key moments in the Lionesses' recent history. The nameless shirts will be auctioned after the match to raise funds for research.
