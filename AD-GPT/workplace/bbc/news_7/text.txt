"Tests which cost millions in the '90s can now be carried out for around £30."For example we now know that defective genes changing the way immune cells called microglia work. "These are the bin lorries of the brain clearing away what they see as rubbish. They may be less efficient at clearing genuine rubbish and mistakenly kill off healthy brain cells, including synapses."Of course synapses are the connections between neurons, so if they get eliminated when they shouldn't then you lose connections, you lose thought, you lose memories."Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Prof Williams said "if you have the right combination of genes there's nothing you can do to prevent Alzheimer's"She said her study of thousands of cases made her realise there will never be one smoking gun, instead, the disease must been seen more like heart disease or stroke where many factors contribute and several therapies will help delay or prevent it. "By 2040 I think we'll be in the position to offer a range of treatment and we might not know exactly why, but one of them will be able to act on the huge range of causes," she said.Some of the drugs have already been cleared for use in other conditions she added, and could be in clinical use inside five years.Related TopicsGeneticsMerthyr TydfilDementiaCardiffCardiff UniversityAlzheimer'sMore on this storyBBC presenter with Alzheimer's thanks listenersPublished2 AprilAlzheimer's research takes 'leap forward'Published4 April 2022I've got dementia - dementia hasn't got mePublished13 October 2021Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished21 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan hails election victory but Turkey dividedPublished1 hour agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan hails election victory but Turkey divided9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
