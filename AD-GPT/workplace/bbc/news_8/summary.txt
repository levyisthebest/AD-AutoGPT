Nora Forster, the wife of former Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon, has died at 80 after a five-year battle with Alzheimer's disease. Lydon had become her full-time carer as her condition deteriorated and had written a song for her, which he tried to enter into this year's Eurovision Song Contest. Lydon has released a new song dedicated to his wife, titled "The One," and has spoken publicly about the challenges of caring for her. The BBC has provided resources and information for those affected by Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
