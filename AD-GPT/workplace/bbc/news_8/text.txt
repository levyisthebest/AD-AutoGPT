"A real sadness filled her because that's an inexplicable pain for a mother to lose her daughter," he told The Times in 2021."From there on it was small issues like constantly losing keys and it builds up over time. It happened so gradually, so slowly, that by the time it becomes a definite it's impossible to trace it through."She was formally diagnosed in 2018, and he became her full-time carer as her condition deteriorated.'No joy comes without pain'She eventually found it difficult to recognise her husband. After Lydon appeared on the US version of TV show The Masked Singer in 2021, he told The Guardian: "I wanted to see if she guessed, and she did."She said, 'Johnny, it's you!' It was one of the best experiences of my life: how rewarding to hear her talk that way and keep her from switching off."He then wrote what he described as a "pensive, personal yet universal love song" about a holiday they had taken to Hawaii, because that was one memory that stood out in her mind."Remember me, I remember you," he sang in the chorus.This YouTube post cannot be displayed in your browser.

"It's also a message of hope that ultimately love conquers all."Earlier this year, Lydon told the Sunday Times he had been deeply changed by taking care of his wife, and didn't know how he would be able to live without her."It's hideous. So pernicious and vile to watch someone you love just slowly disappear," he said.But their life together had been "worth every moment", he said. "No joy comes without pain and, boy, do I know that now."For details of organisations and resources that can help with information and support on Alzheimer's disease and dementia, see the BBC Action Line website.Related TopicsAlzheimer'sMusicMore on this storySex Pistols star fails in Irish Eurovision bidPublished4 FebruaryWill Sex Pistols star be Ireland's Eurovision pick?Published3 FebruaryPunk singer Ari Up dies aged 48Published21 October 2010Top StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished21 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan hails election victory but Turkey dividedPublished1 hour agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan hails election victory but Turkey divided9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
