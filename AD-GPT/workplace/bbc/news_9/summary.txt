The deportation of a British grandmother with Alzheimer's from Sweden has been paused, but her family is calling for a permanent reversal of the decision. The Swedish authorities will continue to plan for the deportation, but have paused any order to carry it out for now. The woman's family is confused about the update on her case and has renewed its pleas for a permanent resolution. Sweden's Minister of Migration said that decisions related to residence applications are made by independent state bodies in line with the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement.
