"I don't know where to go from here," her daughter-in-law said."A lot of British people are actually being sent back to the UK, which is not ok but they're healthy. "She can not do anything. She's bedridden. That's what makes me angry. "They're moving a sick person and her health can deteriorate even more by moving her."
Her family said they have been left confused by the update and renewed their pleas for the situation to be resolved permanently. On Tuesday, Sweden's Minister of Migration, Maria Malmer Stenergard, said in a statement: "Decisions related to residence applications are applied directly by the Swedish state agencies and courts in line with the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement."As laid down in the constitution, the Swedish government is not permitted to interfere in or comment on individual decisions taken by these independent state bodies."With regard to the case in question, I have been informed that the Swedish Migration Agency is in contact with the family concerning additional information."Related TopicsSwedenBrexitAlzheimer'sMore on this storyWoman with Alzheimer's faces Swedish deportationPublished4 AprilMy labour of love caring for wife with Alzheimer'sPublished29 MarchBBC presenter with Alzheimer's thanks listenersPublished2 AprilTop StoriesAlarm at Met Police cut to mental health responsePublished22 minutes agoLive. This Morning returns as Phillip Schofield denies 'toxicity' claimsErdogan hails election victory but Turkey dividedPublished1 hour agoFeaturesWhy famous faces are popping up on UK streets'I hit rock bottom while trying to have a baby'What next for ITV, Holly and This Morning?Who is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Entire village burned down by marauding Darfur militiasRicky Gervais’ first BBC project in 10 years on ‘life, death and hope’What to expect from newly emboldened Erdogan'No-one else should have to use rags for sanitary pads'Katty Kay: A growing case of transatlantic heartburnElsewhere on the BBCDo anti-snoring products actually work?Greg Foot speaks to experts to find out...AttributionSoundsSwapping the newsroom for road trips...Journalist and adventure chaser Clive Myrie picks his favourite road trip musicAttributionSounds'I was a classic sort of class clown'Comedian and writer, Robert Webb, shares the soundtrack of his lifeAttributionSoundsIs this the strangest prison escape?In June 1962, three prisoners escaped from the maximum security US jail, AlcatrazAttributionSoundsMost Read1Athlete dies during triathlon swim stage2Flesh-eating bug nearly kills new mother3Alarm at Met Police cut to mental health response4Four dead as tourist boat sinks in Italy - reports5Mars bar plastic wrapper swapped for paper6Price cap backlash and ITV 'toxic culture' claims7Urn taken from Dame Vivienne Westwood's grave8Erdogan hails election victory but Turkey divided9Fresh attack on Kyiv after intense drone barrage10Food price cap will not make a difference - retailersBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsBest of the BBCFrom 60s hippy to multibillionaire.
