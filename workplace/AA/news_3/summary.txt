The Alzheimer's Association has improved two online resources, ALZNavigator and ALZConnected, to provide better care planning and support for individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia and their caregivers. ALZNavigator creates custom action plans based on the individual's current situation with the disease, while ALZConnected is a free online community for people living with dementia and their caregivers to engage and get support from others sharing common experiences and challenges.
