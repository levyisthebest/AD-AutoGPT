The Alzheimer's Association has praised Eli Lilly's positive results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ2 Phase 3 clinical trial of donanemab for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. The trial met all primary and secondary endpoints, with almost half of participants showing no decline in cognition and function for a year. The Association has called for Medicare to provide immediate, full coverage for FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments, including donanemab.
