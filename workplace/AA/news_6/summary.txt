The Alzheimer's Association has called for access to FDA-approved Alzheimer's treatments during CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure's testimony before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Health Subcommittee. Members of Congress from both parties have urged the administrator to reverse CMS's decision to block access to these treatments, as Medicare has always covered them. Each day of blocked access results in over 2,000 people transitioning to a more advanced stage of Alzheimer's where they are no longer eligible for treatment.
