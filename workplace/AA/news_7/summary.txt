The Alzheimer's Association International Conference Satellite Symposium, co-hosted by the Global Brain Health Institute, will bring together over 200 dementia scientists, clinicians, and health professionals in Mexico City from May 17-19 to discuss the latest Alzheimer's and other dementia research in Latin America. The symposium will address unique challenges, such as dementia prevalence, genetic and ancestral contributions to Alzheimer's risk, culturally specific lifestyle interventions for dementia risk reduction, biomarkers and early diagnosis, drug and non-drug interventions, and how culture and language impact testing, treatment, and health-related behaviors. The Alzheimer's Association and GBHI will also announce a new research funding opportunity to help build capacity for scientific investigation in low- and middle-income countries.
