Certain genes, including APOE, increase the risk of getting Alzheimer's disease, but genes are not the only factor involved. Other genes linked to Alzheimer's include ABCA7, CLU, CR1, PICALM, PLD3, TREM2, and SORL1. Genetic testing is not routinely recommended for late-onset Alzheimer's, but may be helpful for early-onset or certain treatments. Researchers are studying genes that may protect against Alzheimer's and finding new ways to prevent and treat it.
