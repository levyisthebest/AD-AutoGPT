Dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORAs), a class of drugs used to treat insomnia, have been found to reduce levels of amyloid-β and tau proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, which are critical for driving Alzheimer's disease. A small proof-of-concept study showed a 10-15% drop in phosphorylation at a site on tau and a 10-20% reduction in amyloid-β levels in participants who received the higher dose of the drug. Further research is needed to understand how this approach may affect the development of Alzheimer's disease.
