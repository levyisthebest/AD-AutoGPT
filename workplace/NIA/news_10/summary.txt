A new cardiac rehabilitation program, tailored to individual patients and started earlier, has shown physical and emotional benefits for heart failure patients, according to a clinical trial. The program improved physical function, frailty, quality of life, and depression in hospitalized heart failure patients compared to traditional rehabilitation programs. However, the study did not show significant differences in related clinical events including rates of hospital readmission for any reason or for heart-failure related rehospitalizations.
