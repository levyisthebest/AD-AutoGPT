A study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that the progression of Alzheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome is similar to other genetic, early-onset forms of the disease. The study suggests that individuals with Alzheimer's and Down syndrome may benefit from participating in studies on Alzheimer's therapies aimed at slowing the formation of amyloid plaques.
