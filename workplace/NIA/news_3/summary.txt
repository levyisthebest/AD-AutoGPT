Two research teams have discovered a new molecular pathway shared by ALS and FTD, which involves the mislocalization of a protein called TDP-43. This mislocalization alters the genetic instructions for UNC13A, a gene important for maintaining connections between neurons and a risk factor for both disorders. Increasing levels of UNC13A may prevent neuron death in these disorders, and the findings could potentially be extended to other degenerative diseases.
