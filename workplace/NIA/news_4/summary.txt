Bumetanide, an oral diuretic pill, may be a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease in individuals at genetic risk, according to a study published in Nature Aging. The study found that those who took bumetanide had a lower prevalence of Alzheimer's disease compared to those not taking the drug. The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging and advances a precision medicine approach for those at greater risk of the disease due to their genetics.
