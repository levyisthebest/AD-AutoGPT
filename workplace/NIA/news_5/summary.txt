The National Institute on Aging has added two new research institutions in North Carolina and Texas to its network of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias centers. The centers will focus on researching early and midlife risk factors for Alzheimer's and ways to diminish the burden of the disease on understudied groups. The NIA now has 33 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers nationwide, plus four exploratory centers.
