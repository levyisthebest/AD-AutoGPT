A study by the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, along with the University of North Carolina, found that a diet higher in fatty fish can reduce the frequency and intensity of migraines compared to a diet higher in vegetable-based fats and oils. The study of 182 adults with frequent migraines found that a diet lower in vegetable oil and higher in fatty fish produced between 30% and 40% reductions in total headache hours per day, severe headache hours per day, and overall headache days per month compared to the control group. The researchers hope to expand this work to study effects of diet on other chronic pain conditions.
