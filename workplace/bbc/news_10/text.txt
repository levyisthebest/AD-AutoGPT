The devastating blow came just months after Ruby, from Merthyr Tydfil, had lost her great-grandmother to dementia. At the time, in 2018, she felt unable to talk about it or even cry, with people saying "be brave for mam".After suffering anxiety, Ruby is slowly regaining confidence and wants everyone to be open about their feelings."It was one of the most horrible feelings," she said, looking back.

The morning he died came as a real shock and I miss him lots."Everyone would say 'be brave for mam'. I felt I had to be fine. There were no tears or anything. I had to keep myself away if I had to deal with emotion."Image source, Youth Sport TrustImage caption, Ruby fundraises for the Alzheimer's Society after her great-grandmother's deathIt was five years ago, when Ruby was seven that her great-grandmother died from vascular dementia and Alzheimer's. Then, in December of 2018, her dad Jamie, who was 38, had been talking about a family holiday before he went to bed. But he never woke up - dying suddenly and unexpectedly from a blood clot. Remembering him fondly, Ruby says: "Dad was a nutter, to be fair. He was just full of laughter."While she is able to talk openly about her father now, when she transitioned from primary to high school, her teachers noticed she was quiet and lacking in confidence.Image source, Family photoImage caption, Ruby remembers her dad as being "full of laughter"Looking back, Ruby says she was experiencing feelings of anxiety about a lot of things, and not sharing these only made her situation worse."It was definitely one of the most challenging things I've ever experienced... I didn't talk when I was at my lowest," she added.It was at this point her teacher signed her up to the Youth Sport Trust's active in mind programme. 'Confident and bubbly'Through a series of games and activities, Ruby was encouraged to discuss her mental health, as well as considering good habits to nurture a healthy mind.She was one of 21,216 young people that were part of the six-week programme in Wales and England. In groups of 15, they were led by an athlete mentor and five mental health champions."We had our world turned upside down and shattered," Ruby's mother Adele admitted.She believes her daughter has "changed so much" as a result of the sessions and is now that "confident and bubbly" pupil in the classroom again."Her dad would be so proud of her," Adele added.

"Young people should never be afraid to share their emotions and how they are feeling."Don't be afraid to cry. I'm not here to judge you for crying."Youth Sport Trust chief executive Ali Oliver added: "In the shadow of the pandemic, we are taking urgent action to help the many young people who are struggling with their mental health, and to support schools with practical advice and help. "A cost of living emergency is increasing inequality across society and these worries are having an impact on young people too."A SPECIAL SCHOOL: Behind the scenes at a school like no otherDARE TO DANCE: 'When I dance I feel like I can overcome anything'Related TopicsMerthyr TydfilDementiaMindMental healthAlzheimer'sMore on this storyBoy felt pushed around by mental health providersPublished27 November 2022Teenagers in need of counselling turn to drugsPublished22 June 2022Call to ease child-adult mental health transitionPublished15 May 2022Kate launches campaign on early years developmentPublished28 JanuaryAround the BBCBBC - Information and Support- BereavementTop StoriesHarry and Meghan in 'near catastrophic car chase'Published6 minutes agoDeadly New Zealand hostel fire was arson - policePublished6 hours agoChina fines comedy troupe $2m for military jokePublished5 hours agoFeaturesAsia is spending to boost birth rates - will it work?To kiss or not - the taboo around public affection in IndiaOnce banned, boxing now thrives in this former warzoneResistance man breaks 80-year silence over executed GermansSlurping Spaghetti and other food photo contest winnersWhy Bud Light and Disney are under attackRecord inflation: Five ways Argentines try to copeThe backlash against dimly-lit moviesFinding Anwar - born while his mother fled for her lifeElsewhere on the BBCThree job categories safe from AIThe films 'too bad for the cinema'Why did the US plan to nuke the Moon?Most Read1Harry and Meghan in 'near catastrophic car chase'2Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before3World likely to warm beyond key 1.5C limit by 20274Break-in at Biden aide's home while agents outside5Sarkozy to wear tag after losing corruption appeal6China fines comedy troupe $2m for military joke7Court orders Elizabeth Holmes to go to prison8UK car giant warns Brexit may force factory closure9F1 race cancelled as deadly floods hit Italy10Dozens held in India after Islamic State film rowBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2023 BBC.
