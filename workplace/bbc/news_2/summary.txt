An 85-year-old man with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease has been able to play football again thanks to a care home in Derbyshire. The home introduced a scheme where residents could pick one wish and the staff would help make it come true. Mr Mansfield's wish was to play football again, and the home's dementia care coach found a walking football group for him to join. He has been attending sessions every week since February with the support of family and care home staff.
