Former Ipswich Town and England striker Trevor Whymark has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. His family has revealed his condition to raise awareness and help others. Whymark played under Sir Bobby Robson at Ipswich from 1970 to 1979 and also won a cap for England. His son Craig has set up a fundraiser for the Alzheimer's Society in his father's name. Whymark's heading skills as a child may have contributed to his condition, according to his son.
