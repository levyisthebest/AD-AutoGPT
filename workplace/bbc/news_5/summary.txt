Radio presenter Susan Rae, who was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's last year, has thanked listeners for their support and messages. Her sons launched an appeal to support her move to assisted living, which has raised Â£40,000 in five days. Alzheimer's disease affects the brain and is the most common cause of dementia, with memory loss being one of the most common symptoms.
