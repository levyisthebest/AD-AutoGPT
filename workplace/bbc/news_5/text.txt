"And then it started getting a bit more drastic, especially when I was actually at work." She said that with some of the broadcasting work, she could record it again "but of course, the live stuff finds you out".In a message for the fundraiser, Rae's son Rory Cargill said that, after 30 years on air, his mum had been left unable to work because of the condition.Alzheimer's disease affects the brain, and it is the most common cause of dementia. One of the most common symptoms is memory loss, and it can affect people of different ages - but over-65s are more susceptible to the disease.Rae, who is 66, said she still felt physically very strong, which is often a good thing. But in other ways, she adds, "you wish your brain was a great deal stronger than your physical body".

But she told the programme that her biggest challenge was dealing with loneliness in her new home."I've lost a lot of my friends," she said. "I haven't physically lost them but I've missed being at the BBC with all my friends. That's the biggest thing."Among those who have given donations to the fundraiser are several Radio 4 and Radio 3 listeners who remember her decades on air, working as a journalist, newsreader, continuity announcer and even reading the shipping forecast. One paid tribute to her "melodious Scottish voice". Asked about the public support towards her fundraiser, Rae said: "I just want to say that this has been the most extraordinary moment about all of this. I'm overwhelmed actually." "All these people have been in touch with lovely messages. People are generally great. And thank you so much. I'm so chuffed. Thank you."Image caption, Susan Rae (middle) presented Radio 4's You and Yours, in this picture taken in 1990 Susan is alongside fellow presenters at the time, John Buckley (left) and John Howard (right).Paddy O'Connell's interview with Susan Rae is available on BBC Sounds, and you can listen to it here.MISSING GOLD: The inside story of Britain's biggest gold heistDECADES OF DISHONESTY: Everyone has their own version of right and wrong...Related TopicsAlzheimer'sTop StoriesHarry and Meghan in 'near catastrophic car chase'Published5 minutes agoDeadly New Zealand hostel fire was arson - policePublished6 hours agoChina fines comedy troupe $2m for military jokePublished5 hours agoFeaturesAsia is spending to boost birth rates - will it work?To kiss or not - the taboo around public affection in IndiaOnce banned, boxing now thrives in this former warzoneResistance man breaks 80-year silence over executed GermansSlurping Spaghetti and other food photo contest winnersWhy Bud Light and Disney are under attackRecord inflation: Five ways Argentines try to copeThe backlash against dimly-lit moviesFinding Anwar - born while his mother fled for her lifeElsewhere on the BBCThree job categories safe from AIThe films 'too bad for the cinema'Why did the US plan to nuke the Moon?Most Read1Harry and Meghan in 'near catastrophic car chase'2Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before3World likely to warm beyond key 1.5C limit by 20274Break-in at Biden aide's home while agents outside5Sarkozy to wear tag after losing corruption appeal6China fines comedy troupe $2m for military joke7Court orders Elizabeth Holmes to go to prison8UK car giant warns Brexit may force factory closure9F1 race cancelled as deadly floods hit Italy10Dozens held in India after Islamic State film rowBBC News ServicesOn your mobileOn smart speakersGet news alertsContact BBC NewsHomeNewsSportReelWorklifeTravelFutureCultureMusicTVWeatherSoundsTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with us© 2023 BBC.
