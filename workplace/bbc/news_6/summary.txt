An 83-year-old man from Swindon, Brian Lea, has been caring for his wife Dawn, who has Alzheimer's, for 12 years. He describes it as a "labour of love" and is grateful to be able to return the favour after she always put him first in their long marriage. Despite the challenges, he loves his wife "more" than ever and thanks the Swindon Dementia Support Team for their help.
