I didn't turn up twice."However, his now wife persevered, and three months after their first meeting he realised she was "somebody special" that he wanted to marry at 18.Describing himself as "lucky", the ex-body builder said it had "worked out" well for him.Mrs Lea was diagnosed with Alzheimer's 12 years ago following a visit to the GP for shoulder pain.She was referred to a memory clinic after friends noticed she was telling the same stories.Image source, Family handoutImage caption, Brian and Dawn Lea were married on 16 August 1958 at St Mary's Church, Rodbourne in SwindonThe condition soon progressed, affecting her mobility and her ability to do every day tasks, which prompted Mr Lea's decision to stop working to look after her full time.The former quality manager for Pilkington said his "wonderful wife" and mother to their son, was his first priority."I'd phone Dawn from work at lunch times and she'd be crying because she couldn't work the TV, the phone or even know how to put the heating on anymore."I started to reduce the number of days and eventually I stopped working altogether five years ago. Dawn came first.""I can't imagine what it would be like looking after her, If I didn't feel the way that I do. "Doing the things I have to do for her. It's a labour of love and I'm grateful for that," he added.Mr Lea said while his wife can no longer recall details from their relationship or former life, he hangs onto the little moments - especially the times when she tells him "I love you" and blows him kisses.He acknowledged that caring full-time for his wife was "hard work" and thanked the Swindon Dementia Support Team for doing "that little bit more than they have to"."I couldn't have gone on this long without the help I've had. They have been a Godsend," he added.Helen, a dementia advisor from the Swindon Dementia Support Team, who visits him regularly said they "talk to people and help them try and find the laughter and help them cope".Image source, Family handoutImage caption, Mr Lea thanked the Swindon Dementia Support Team, run by the Alzheimer's Society, for all their helpShe urged those needing support to come forward and not "beat yourself up".Mr Lea said although at time he found it hard, he had never once questioned who would look after his "selfless" wife.He said: "I always came first. It was always what do I need, what would I like... I just wanted to pay back the favour."Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
