Healthy older adults tend to struggle with tasks requiring working memory - such as reading, listening and problem-solving, which can impact their day-to-day lives, they said.
"Clearly distinguishing normal forgetfulness from dementia will help scientists and medical professionals catch and treat the condition early in its progression," the university said.
Lead researcher Dr Vanessa Loaiza said: "This study will help us learn more about Alzheimer's from the people on the frontline of the disease.
"We know how devastating a diagnosis can be and that's why we are using Zoom to make it as easy as possible for them to join our study from the comfort of their own homes. "Although it is early stages, this research could help us find the difference between an ordinary 'senior moment' and something a lot more serious."
