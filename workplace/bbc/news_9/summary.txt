Alzheimer's disease is a common cause of dementia that affects the brain and can make it difficult for people to remember things, recognize family members, and behave in unusual ways. It usually affects those over 65 and the number of people with dementia is increasing due to people living longer. By 2025, it is estimated that the number of people with dementia in the UK will have gone up to around one million. Support is available for families dealing with the disease.
